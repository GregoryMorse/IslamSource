Islam Source Plugin to insert Quranic verses and calligraphy of Islamic phrases easily and simply.

== Description ==

Islam Source Quranic Verse and Islamic Phrase Plugin - Allows for Quranic chapters, verses even specified down through the word to be inserted easily by using formats {a:b:c-x:y:z} where b, c, x, y and z are optional depending on if a chapter, verse or particular word of a verse is desired or a range is desired so it could be in forms {a:b-y} or {a:b-x:y} such as the opening chapter which could be specified as {1:1-7}.  The Arabic is automatically displayed when posts are viewed.  It also allows for various calligraphy and Unicode Islamic words or phrases to be easily inserted through a button on the visual editor which are displayed when the posts are later viewed.
