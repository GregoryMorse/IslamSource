In (the) name|(of) Allah,|the Most Gracious,|the Most Merciful.
All praises and thanks|(be) to Allah,|(the) Lord|(of all) the worlds.
The Most Gracious,|the Most Merciful.
Master|(of the) Day|(of) [the] Judgment.
You Alone|we worship,|and You Alone|we ask for help.
Guide us|(to) the path,|the straight.
(The) path|(of) those|You have bestowed (Your) Favors|on them,|not (of)|those who earned (Your) wrath|on themselves,|and not|(of) those who go astray.
Alif Laam Meem
That|(is) the Book,|no|doubt|in it,|a Guidance|for the God-conscious.
Those who|believe|in the unseen,|and establish|the prayer,|and out of what|We have provided them|they spend.
And those who|believe|in what|(is) sent down|to you|and what|was sent down|before you,||and in the Hereafter|they|firmly believe.
Those|(are) on|Guidance|from|their Lord,|and those -|they|(are) the successful ones.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve[d],|(it) is same|to them|whether you warn them|or|not|you warn them,|not|they believe.
Allah has set a seal||on|their hearts|and on|their hearing,|and on|their vision|(is) a veil.|And for them|(is) a punishment|great.
And of|the people|(are some) who|say,|"We believed|in Allah|and in the Day|[the] Last,"|but not|they|(are) believers (at all).
They seek to deceive Allah||and those who|believe[d],|and not|they deceive|except|themselves,|and not|they realize (it).
In|their hearts|(is) a disease,|so Allah increased them||(in) disease;|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful|because|they used (to)|[they] lie.
And when|it is said|to them,|"(Do) not|spread corruption|in|the earth,"|they say,|"Only|we|(are) reformers."
Beware,|indeed they|themselves|(are) the ones who spread corruption,|[and] but|not|they realize (it).
And when|it is said|to them,|"Believe|as|believed|the people,"|they say,|"Should we believe|as|believed|the fools?"|Beware,|certainly they|themselves|(are) the fools|[and] but|not|they know.
And when|they meet|those who|believe[d],|they say,|"We believe[d]."|But when|they are alone|with|their evil ones,|they say,|"Indeed, we|(are) with you,|only|we|(are) mockers."
Allah|mocks|at them,|and prolongs them|in|their transgression,|they wander blindly.
Those|(are) the ones who|bought|[the] astraying|for [the] guidance.|So not|profited|their commerce|and not|were they|guided-ones.
Their example|(is) like (the) example|(of) the one who|kindled|a fire,|then, when|it lighted|his surroundings,||Allah took away||their light|and left them|in|darkness[es],|(so) they (do) not see.|
Deaf,|dumb,|blind,|so they|[they] will not return.|
Or|like a rainstorm|from|the sky|in it (are)|darkness[es],|and thunder,|and lightning.|They put|their fingers|in|their ears|from|the thunderclaps|(in) fear (of)|[the] death.|And Allah|(is) [the One Who] encompasses|the disbelievers.
Almost|the lightning|snatches away|their sight.|Whenever|it flashes|for them|they walk|in it,|and when|it darkens|on them|they stand (still).|And if|Allah had willed,||He would certainly have taken away|their hearing,|and their sight.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
O mankind ||worship|your Lord,|the One Who|created  you|and those [who]|before you,||so that you may|become righteous.
The One Who|made|for you|the earth|a resting place|and the sky|a canopy,|and sent down|from|the sky|water,|then brought forth|therewith|[of]|the fruits|(as) provision|for you.|So (do) not|set up|to Allah|rivals|while you|[you] know.
And if|you are|in|doubt|about what|We have revealed|to|Our slave,|then produce|a chapter|[of]|like it|and call|your witnesses||other than|Allah|if|you are|truthful.
But if|not|you do,|and never|will you do,|then fear|the Fire|whose|[its] fuel|(is) [the] men|and [the] stones,|prepared|for the disbelievers.
And give good news|(to) those who|believe,|and do|[the] righteous deeds,|that|for them|(will be) Gardens,|flow|[from]|under them|the rivers.|Every time|they are provided|therefrom|of|fruit|(as) provision,|they (will) say,|"This (is)|the one which|we were provided|before."||And they will be given||(things) in resemblance;|And for them|therein|spouses|purified,|and they|therein|(will) abide forever.
Indeed, Allah||(is) not ashamed||to set forth||an example|(like) even|(of) a mosquito|and (even) something|above it.|Then as for|those who|believed,|[thus] they will know|that it|(is) the truth|from|their Lord.|And as for|those who|disbelieved|[thus] they will say|what|(did) Allah intend||by this|example?|He lets go astray|by it|many|and He guides|by it|many.|And not|He lets go astray|by it|except|the defiantly disobedient.
Those who|break|(the) Covenant of Allah||after||its ratification,|and [they] cut|what|Allah has ordered||it|to be joined||and [they] spread corruption|in the earth.||Those,|they|(are) the losers.
How|(can) you disbelieve|in Allah?|While you were|dead|then He gave you life;|then|He will cause you to die,|then|He will give you life,|then|to Him|you will be returned.
He|(is) the One Who|created|for you|what|(is) in the earth,||all.|Moreover|He turned|to|the heaven|and fashioned them|seven|heavens.|And He|of every|thing|(is) All-Knowing.
And when|said|your Lord|to the angels,|"Indeed, I (am)|going to place|in|the earth|a vicegerent,|they said,|"Will You place|in it|(one) who|will spread corruption|in it|and will shed|[the] blood[s],|while we,|[we] glorify (You)|with Your praises|and we sanctify|[to] You."|He said,|"Indeed, I|[I] know|what|you (do) not know."|
And He taught|Adam|the names -|all of them.|Then|He displayed them|to|the angels,|then He said,|"Inform Me|of (the) names|(of) these,|if|you are|truthful."
They said,|"Glory be to You |No knowledge||(is) for us|except|what|You have taught us.|Indeed You |You|(are) the All-Knowing,|the All-Wise.
He said,|"O Adam |Inform them|of their names."|And when|he had informed them|of their names,|He said,|"Did not|I say|to you,|Indeed, I|[I] know|(the) unseen|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and I know|what|you reveal|and what|you [were]|conceal."
And when|We said|to the angels,|"Prostrate|to Adam,"|[so] they prostrated|except|Iblees.|He refused|and was arrogant|and became|of|the disbelievers.
And We said,|"O Adam |Dwell|you|and your spouse|(in) Paradise,|and [you both] eat|from it|freely|(from) wherever|you [both] wish.|But do not [you two] approach||this|[the] tree,|lest you [both] be|of|the  wrongdoers."
Then made [both of] them slip|the Shaitaan|from it,|and he got [both of] them out|from what|they [both] were|in [it].|And We said,|"Go down (all of you),|some of you|to others|(as) enemy;|and for you|in|the earth|(is) a dwelling place|and a provision|for|a period."
Then Adam received||from|his Lord|words,|So (his Lord) turned|towards him.|Indeed He |He|(is) the Oft-returning (to mercy),|the Most Merciful.
We said,|"Go down|from it|all (of you),|and when,|comes to you|from Me|Guidance,|then whoever|follows|My Guidance,|[then] no|fear|(will be) on them|and not|they|will grieve.
And those|who disbelieve[d]|and deny|Our Signs,|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire;|they|in it|(will) abide forever."
O Children|(of) Israel |Remember|My Favor|which|I bestowed|upon you|and fulfill,|My Covenant|I will fulfill|your covenant|and Me Alone|fear [Me].
And believe|in what|I have sent down|confirming|that which|(is) with you,|and (do) not|be|(the) first|disbeliever|of it.|And (do) not|exchange|My Signs (for)|a price|small,|and Me Alone|fear [Me].
And (do) not|mix|the Truth|with [the] falsehood|and conceal|the Truth|while you|[you] know.
And establish|the prayer|and give|zakah|and bow down|with|those who bow down.
Do you order|[the] people|[the] righteousness|and you forget|yourselves,|while you|[you] recite|the Book?|Then, will not|you use reason?
And seek help|through patience|and the prayer;|and indeed, it|(is) surely difficult|except|on|the humble ones,
Those who|believe|that they|will meet|their Lord|and that they|to Him|will return.
O Children|(of) Israel |Remember|My Favor|which|I bestowed|upon you|and that I|[I] preferred  you|over|the worlds.
And fear|a day,|(will) not|avail|any soul|(another) soul||anything,|and not|will be accepted|from it|any intercession,|and not|will be taken|from it|a compensation,|and not|they|will be helped.
And when|We saved you|from|(the) people of Firaun||(who were) afflicting you (with)|horrible|torment,|slaughtering|your sons|and letting live|your women.|And in|that|(was) a trial|from|your Lord|great.
And when|We parted|for you|the sea,|then We saved you,|and We drowned|(the) people of Firaun||while you|(were) looking.
And when|We appointed|(for) Musa|forty|nights.|Then|you took|the calf|after him||and you|(were) wrongdoers.
Then|We forgave|you||after|that,|so that you may|(be) grateful.
And when|We gave|Musa|the Book|and the Criterion,|perhaps you|(would be) guided.
And when|said|Musa|to his people,|"O my people |Indeed, you|[you] have wronged|yourselves|by your taking|the calf.|So turn in repentance|to|your Creator,|and kill|yourselves.|That|(is) better|for you|with|your Creator."|Then He turned|towards you.|Indeed He |He|(is) the Oft-returning,|the Most Merciful.
And when|you said,|"O Musa |Never|(will) we believe you||until|we see|Allah|manifestly."|So seized you|the thunderbolt|while you|(were) looking.
Then|We revived you||after|your death,|so that you may|(be) grateful.
And We shaded|[over] you|(with) [the] clouds|and We sent down|to you|[the] manna|and [the] quails,|"Eat|from|(the) good things|that|We have provided you."|And not|they wronged Us,|but|they were|(to) themselves|doing wrong.
And when|We said,|"Enter|this|town,|then eat|from [it]|wherever|you wish[ed]|abundantly,|and enter|the gate|prostrating.|And say,|'Repentance,'|We will forgive|for you|your sins.|And We will increase|the good-doers (in reward)."
But changed|those who|wronged|(the) word|other (than)|that which|was said|to them;|so We sent down|upon|those who|wronged,|a punishment|from|the sky|because|they were|defiantly disobeying.
And when|Musa asked (for) water||for his people,|[so] We said,|"Strike|with your staff|the stone."|Then gushed forth|from it|twelve|springs.|Knew|||all|(the) people|their drinking place.|"Eat|and drink|from|(the) provision (of)|Allah,|and (do) not|act wickedly|in|the earth|spreading corruption."
And when|you said,|"O Musa |Never (will)|we endure|[on]|food|(of) one (kind),|so pray|for us|(to) your Lord|to bring forth|for us|out of what|grows|the earth,|of|its herbs,|[and] its cucumbers,|[and] its garlic,|[and] its lentils,|and its onions."|He said,|"Would you exchange|that which|[it]|(is) inferior|for that which|[it]|(is) better?|Go down|(to) a city,|so indeed|for you|(is) what|you have asked (for)."|And were struck|on them|the humiliation|and the misery|and they drew on themselves wrath||of|Allah|That (was)|because they|used to|disbelieve|in (the) Signs|(of) Allah|and kill|the Prophets|without (any)|[the] right.|That|(was) because|they disobeyed|and they were|transgressing.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and those who|became Jews|and the Christians|and the Sabians -|who|believed|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last|and did|righteous deeds,|so for them|(is) their reward|with|their Lord|and no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
And when|We took|your covenant|and We raised|over you|the mount,|"Hold|what|We have given you|with strength,|and remember|what|(is) in it,|perhaps you|(would become) righteous."
Then|you turned away||after|that.|So if not|(for the) Grace of Allah||upon you|and His Mercy,|surely you would have been|of|the losers.
And indeed,|you knew|those who|transgressed|among you|in the (matter of) Sabbath.||So We said|to them,|"Be|apes,|despised."
So We made it|a deterrent punishment|for those|(in) front of them||and those after them||and an admonition|for those who fear (Allah).
And when|Musa said||to his people,|"Indeed, Allah||commands you|that|you slaughter|a cow."|They said,|"Do you take us|(in) ridicule."|He said,|"I seek refuge|in Allah|that|I be|among|the ignorant."
They said,|"Pray|for us|(to) your Lord|to make clear|to us|what|it (is)."|He said,|"Indeed, He|says,|'[Indeed] it|(is) a cow|not|old|and not|young,|middle aged|between|that,'|so do|what|you are commanded."
They said,|"Pray|for us|(to) your Lord|to make clear|to us|what|(is) its color."|He said,|"Indeed, He|says,|'[Indeed] it is|a cow|yellow,|bright|(in) its color,|pleasing|(to) those who see (it).'"
They said,|"Pray|for us|(to) your Lord|to make clear|to us|what|it (is).|Indeed,|[the] cows|look alike|to us.|And indeed we,|if|wills Allah,||(will) surely be those who are guided."
He said,|"Indeed, He|says,|'[Indeed] it|(is) a cow|not|trained|to plough|the earth,|and not|water|the field;|sound,|no|blemish|in it.'"|They said,|"Now|you have come|with the truth."|So they slaughtered it,|and not|they were near|(to) doing (it).
And when|you killed|a man,|then you disputed|concerning it,|but Allah|(is) the One Who brought forth|what|you were|concealing.
So We said,|"Strike him|with a part of it."|Like this|Allah revives||the dead,|and shows you|His Signs,|perhaps you may|use your intellect.
Then hardened||your hearts||after|that|so they|(became) like [the] stones|or|stronger|(in) hardness.|And indeed,|from|the stones|certainly (there are some) which|gush forth|from it|[the] rivers,|and indeed,|from them|certainly (there are some) which|split,|so comes out|from it|[the] water,|and indeed,|from them|certainly (there are some) which|fall down|from|fear|(of) Allah.|And Allah (is) not||unaware|of what|you do.
Do you hope|that|they will believe|[for] you|while indeed (there) has been||a party|of them,|(who used to) hear|(the) words of Allah,||then|they distort it|after||[what]|they understood it,|while they|know?
And when|they meet|those who|believe[d],|they say,|"We have believed."|But when|meet in private||some of them|with some (others),|they say,|"Do you tell them|what|Allah has revealed||to you|so that they argue with you|therewith|before|your Lord?|Then do (you) not|understand?"
Do not|they know|that|Allah|knows|what|they conceal|and what|they declare?
And among them|(are) unlettered ones,|(who) do not know||the book|except|wishful thinking|and not|they|(do anything) except|guess.
So woe|to those who|write|the book|with their (own) hands|then,|they say,|"This|(is) from Allah,"|||to barter|with it|(for) a price|little.|So woe|to them|for what|have written|their hands|and woe|to them|for what|they earn.
And they say,|"Never|will touch us|the Fire|except|(for) days|numbered."|Say,|"Have you taken|from|Allah|a covenant,|so never|will Allah break||His Covenant?|Or|(do) you say|against|Allah|what|you (do) not know?"|
Yes,|whoever|earned|evil|and surrounded him||his sins -|[so] those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire;|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
And those who|believed|and did|righteous deeds,|those|(are the) companions|(of) Paradise;|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
And when|We took|(the) covenant|(from the) Children|(of) Israel,|"You will not worship||except|Allah,|and with [the] parents|(be) good|and (with) relatives||and [the] orphans|and the needy,|and speak|to [the] people|good,|and establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah."|Then|you turned away,|except|a few|of you,|and you (were)|refusing.
And when|We took|your covenant,|"You will not shed||your blood|and (will) not evict||yourselves|from|your homes,"|then|you ratified|while you|(were) witnessing.
Then|you|(are) those|(who) kill|yourselves|and evict|a party|of you|from|their homes,|you support one another|against them|in sin|and [the] transgression.|And if|they come to you|(as) captives,|you ransom them;|while it|(was) forbidden|to you|their eviction.|So do you believe|in part (of)|the Book|and disbelieve|in part?|Then what|(should be the) recompense|(for the one) who|does|that|among you,|except|disgrace|in|the life|(of) the world;|and (on the) Day|of [the] Resurrection|they will be sent back|to|(the) most severe|punishment?|And Allah (is) not||unaware|of what|you do.
Those|(are) the ones who|bought|the life|(of) the world|for the Hereafter;|so not|will be lightened|for them|the punishment|and not|they|will be helped.
And indeed|We gave|Musa|the Book|and We followed up|after him||with [the] Messengers.|And We gave|Isa,|(the) son|(of) Maryam,|[the] clear signs|and We supported him|with the Holy Spirit.||Is it (not) so (that) whenever|came to you|a Messenger|with what|(do) not desire||yourselves,|you acted arrogantly?|So a party|you denied,|and a party|you kill(ed).
And they said,|"Our hearts|(are) wrapped."|Nay,|Allah has cursed them||for their disbelief;|so little|(is) what|they believe.
And when|came to them|a Book|from Allah|||confirming|what (was) with them,||though they used to|before||(that), pray for victory|over|those who|disbelieved -|then when|came to them|what|they recognized,|they disbelieved|in it.|So (the) curse|(of) Allah|(is) on|the disbelievers.
Evil (is) that|(for) which they have sold||themselves,|that|they disbelieve|in what|Allah has revealed,||grudging|that|Allah sends down||of|His Grace|on|whom|He wills|from|His servants.|So they have drawn (on themselves) wrath||upon|wrath.|And for the disbelievers|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Believe|in what|Allah has revealed,"||they say,|"We believe|in what|was revealed|to us."|And they disbelieve|in what|(is) besides it,|while it|(is) the truth|confirming|what|(is) with them.|Say,|"Then why|(did) you kill|(the) Prophets of Allah||before,||if|you were|believers?"
And indeed|came to you|Musa|with [the] clear signs,|then|you took|the calf|after him||and you|(were) wrongdoers.
And when|We took|your covenant|and We raised|over you|the mount,|"Hold|what|We gave you,|with firmness|and listen."|They said,|"We heard|and we disobeyed."|And they were made to drink|in|their hearts|(love of) the calf|because of their disbelief.|Say,|"Evil (is) that|orders you (to do) it||your faith,|if|you are|believers."
Say,|"If -|is|for you|the home|(of) the Hereafter|with Allah||exclusively,||excluding|the mankind,|then wish|(for) [the] death,|if|you are|truthful."
And never (will)|they wish for it,|ever,|because|(of what) sent ahead|their hands.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower|of the wrongdoers.
And surely you will find them|(the) most greedy|(of) [the] mankind|for|life,|and (greedier) than|those who|associate[d] partners (with Allah).|Loves|(each) one of them|if|he could be granted a life|(of) a thousand|year(s).|But not|it|(will) remove him|from|the punishment|that|he should be granted life.|And Allah|(is) All-Seer|of what|they do.
Say,|"Whoever|is|an enemy|to Jibreel -|then indeed he|brought it down|on|your heart|by (the) permission|(of) Allah|confirming|what|(was) before it||and a guidance|and glad tiding(s)|for the believers."
Whoever|is|an enemy|(to) Allah|and His Angels,|and His Messengers,|and Jibreel,|and Meekael,|then indeed|Allah|(is) an enemy|to the disbelievers.
And indeed|We revealed|to you|Verses|clear,|and not|disbelieves in them||except|the defiantly disobedient.
And is (it not that) whenever|they took|a covenant,|threw it away|a party|of them?|Nay,|most of them|(do) not|believe.
And when|came to them|a Messenger|from Allah|||confirming what||(was) with them,|threw away|a party|of|those who|were given|the Book|Allah's Book||behind|their backs|as if they|(do) not.|know
And they followed|what|recite(d)|the devils|over|(the) kingdom|(of) Sulaiman.|And not|disbelieved|Sulaiman|[and] but|the devils|disbelieved,|they teach|the people|[the] magic|and what|was sent down|to|the two angels|in Babylon,|Harut|and Marut.|And not|they both teach|any|one|unless|they [both] say,|"Only|we|(are) a trial,|so (do) not|disbelieve."|But they learn|from those two|what|[they] causes separation|with it|between|the man|and his spouse.|And not|they (could)|at all [be those who] harm|with it|any|one|except|by permission|(of) Allah.|And they learn|what|harms them|and not|profits them.|And indeed|they knew|that whoever|buys it,|not|for him|in|the Hereafter|any|share.|And surely evil|(is) what|they sold|with it|themselves,|if|they were|(to) know.
And if|[that] they|(had) believed|and feared (Allah),|surely (the) reward|from||Allah|(would have been) better,|if|they were|(to) know.
O you|who|believe[d] |"(Do) not|say|'Raina'|and say|'Unzurna'|and listen.|And for the disbelievers|(is) a punishment|painful.
(Do) not|like|those who|disbelieve|from|(the) People of the Book||and not|those who associate partners (with Allah),|that|(there should) be sent down|to you|any|good|from|your Lord.|And Allah|chooses|for His Mercy|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is the) Possessor of [the] Bounty||[the] Great.
What We abrogate||(of)|a sign|or|[We] cause it to be forgotten,|We bring|better|than it|or|similar (to) it.|Do not|you know|that|Allah|over|everything||(is) All-Powerful?
Do not|you know|that,|Allah|for Him|(is the) Kingdom|(of) the heavens|and the earth?|And not|(is) for you||besides|Allah|any|protector|and not|any helper.
Or|(do) you wish|that|you ask|your Messenger|as|was asked|Musa|before?||And whoever|exchanges|[the] disbelief|with [the] faith,|so certainly|he went astray (from)|(the) evenness|(of) the way.
Wish[ed] many||from|(the) People|(of) the Book|if|they could turn you back||after|your (having) faith|(to) disbelievers,|(out of) jealousy|from||themselves,||(even) after|[what]|became clear|to them,|the truth.|So forgive|and overlook|until|Allah brings||His Command.|Indeed,|Allah|on|every|thing|(is) All-Powerful.
And establish|the prayer|and give|[the] zakah.|And whatever|you send forth|for yourselves|of|good (deeds),|you will find it|with Allah.||Indeed, Allah||of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
And they said,|"Never|will enter|the Paradise|except|who|is|(a) Jew[s]|or|(a) Christian[s]."|That|(is) their wishful thinking.|Say,|"Bring|your proof|if|you are|[those who are] truthful."
Yes,|whoever|submits|his face|to Allah|and he|(is) a good-doer,|so for him|(is) his reward|with|his Lord.|And no|fear|(will be) on them|and not|they|(will) grieve.
And said|the Jews,|"Not|the Christians|(are) on|anything,"|and said|the Christians,|"Not|the Jews|(are) on|anything,"|although they|recite|the Book.|Like that|said|those who|(do) not|know,|similar|their saying.|[So] Allah|will judge|between them|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection|in what|they were|[in it]|differing.
And who|(is) more unjust|than (one) who|prevents|(the) masajid|(of) Allah|to|be mentioned|in them|His name,|and strives|for|their destruction?|Those |Not|it is|for them|that|they enter them|except|(like) those in fear.|For them|in|the world|(is) disgrace|and for them|in|the Hereafter|(is) a punishment|great.
And for Allah|(is) the east|and the west,|so wherever|you turn|[so] there|(is the) face|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.
And they said,|"Allah has taken||a son."|Glory be to Him |Nay,|for Him|(is) what|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|All|to Him|(are) humbly obedient.
(The) Originator|(of) the heavens|and the earth |And when|He decrees|a matter,|[so] only|He says|to it|"Be,"|and it becomes.
And said|those who|(do) not|know,|"Why not|Allah speaks to us||or|comes to us|a sign?"|Like that|said|those|before them||similar|their saying.|Became alike|their hearts.|Indeed,|We have made clear|the signs|for people|(who) firmly believe.
Indeed We |[We] have sent you|with the truth,|(as) a bearer of good news|and (as) a warner.|And not|you will be asked|about|(the) companions|(of) the blazing Fire.
And never|will be pleased|with you|the Jews|and [not]|the Christians|until|you follow|their religion.|Say,|"Indeed,|(the) Guidance of Allah,||it|(is) the Guidance."|And if|you follow|their desires|after|what|has come to you|of|the knowledge,|not|for you|from|Allah|any|protector|and not|any helper.
Those,|We have given them|the Book|recite it|(as it has the) right|(of) its recitation.|Those (people)|believe|in it.|And whoever|disbelieves|in it,|then those,|they|(are) the losers.
O Children|(of) Israel |Remember|My Favor|which|I bestowed|upon you|and that I|[I] preferred you|over|the worlds.
And fear|a day|not|will avail|a soul|(another) soul||anything|and not|will be accepted|from it|any compensation,|and not|will benefit it|any intercession,|and not|they|will be helped.
And when|tried|Ibrahim|his Lord|with words|and he fulfilled them,|He said,|"Indeed I|(am) the One to make you|for the mankind|a leader."|He said,|"And from|my offspring?"|He said,|"(Does) not|reach|My Covenant|(to) the wrongdoers."
And when|We made|the House|a place of return|for mankind|and (a place of) security|and (said), "Take|[from]|(the) standing place|(of) Ibrahim,|(as) a place of prayer."|And We made a covenant|with|Ibrahim|and Ismail|[that],|"[You both] purify|My House|for those who circumambulate|and those who seclude themselves for devotion and prayer|and those who bow down|and those who prostrate."
And when|said|Ibrahim,|"My Lord|make|this|a city|secure|and provide|its people|with|fruits,|(to) whoever|believed|from them|in Allah|and the Day|the Last,"|He said,|"And whoever|disbelieved,|[then] I will grant him enjoyment|a little;|then|I will force him|to|(the) punishment|(of) the Fire,|and evil|(is) the destination.
And when|Ibrahim (was) raising||the foundations|of the House||and Ismail,|(saying), "Our Lord |Accept|from us.|Indeed You |[You] (are)|the All-Hearing,|the All-Knowing.
Our Lord |[and] Make us|both submissive|to You.|And from|our offspring|a community|submissive|to You.|And show us|our ways of worship|and turn|to us.|Indeed You |[You] (are)|the Oft-returning,|the Most Merciful
Our Lord |[And] raise up|in them|a Messenger|from them|(who) will recite|to them|Your Verses|and will teach them|the Book|and the wisdom|and purify them.|Indeed You |You (are)|the All-Mighty|the All-Wise."
And who|will turn away from||Ibrahim's religion||except|who|fooled|himself?|And indeed|We chose him|in the world,||and indeed he,|in,|the Hereafter|surely (will be) among|the righteous.
When|said|to him|his Lord|"Submit (yourself),"|he said,|"I (have) submitted (myself)|to (the) Lord|(of) the worlds."
And enjoined|[it]|Ibrahim|(upon) his sons|and Yaqub,|"O my sons |Indeed, Allah||has chosen|for you|the religion,|so you should not die||except|while you|(are) submissive."
Or|were you|witnesses|when|came to|Yaqub|[the] death,|when|he said|to his sons,|"What|will you worship|after me?"||They said,|"We will worship|your God|and (the) God|(of) your forefathers,|Ibrahim|and Ismail|and Ishaq -|God|One.|And we|to Him|(are) submissive."
This|(was) a community|(which) has passed away,||for it|what it earned||and for you|what|you earned.|And not|you will be asked|about what|they used to|do.
And they said,|"Be|Jews|or|Christians,|(then) you will be guided."|Say,|"Nay,|(the) religion|(of) Ibrahim,|(the) upright;|and not|he was|of|those who associated partners (with Allah)."
Say,|"We have believed|in Allah|and what|(is) revealed|to us|and what|was revealed|to|Ibrahim|and Ismail|and Ishaq|and Yaqub|and the descendants,|and what|was given|(to) Musa|and Isa|and what|was given|(to) the Prophets|from|their Lord.|Not|we make distinction|between|any|of them.|And we|to Him|(are) submissive. "
So if|they believe[d]|in (the) like|(of) what|you have believed|in [it],|then indeed,|they are (rightly) guided.|But if|they turn away,|then only|they|(are) in|dissension.|So Allah will suffice you against them,||and He|(is) the All-Hearing,|the All-Knowing.
(The) color (religion)|(of) Allah |And who|(is) better|than|Allah at coloring?||And we|to Him|(are) worshippers.
Say,|"Do you argue with us|about|Allah|while He|(is) our Lord|and your Lord?|And for us|(are) our deeds|and for you|(are) your deeds|and we|to Him|(are) sincere.
Or|(do) you say|that|Ibrahim|and Ismail|and Ishaq|and Yaqub|and the descendants|were|Jews|or|Christians?"|Say,|"Are you|better knowing|or (is) Allah?"||And who|(is) more unjust|than (the one) who|concealed|a testimony|(that) he has|from|Allah?|And not|(is) Allah|unaware|of what|you do.
This|(was) a community|(which) has passed away.||For it|what|it earned|and for you|what|you have earned.|And not|you will be asked|about what|they used to|do.
Will say|the foolish ones|from|the people,|"What|(has) turned them|from|their direction of prayer|which|they were used to|[on it]."|Say,|"For Allah|(is) the east|and the west.|He guides|whom|He wills|to|a path|straight."
And thus|We made you|a community|(of the) middle way|so that you will be|witnesses|over|the mankind,|and will be|the Messenger|on you|a witness.|And not|We made|the direction of prayer|which|you were used to|[on it]|except|that We make evident|(he) who|follows|the Messenger|from (he) who|turns back|on|his heels.|And indeed,|it was|certainly a great (test)|except|for|those whom|Allah guided.||And not|will Allah||let go waste|your faith.|Indeed, Allah||(is) to [the] mankind|Full of Kindness,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|We see|(the) turning|(of) your face|towards|the heaven.|So We will surely turn you|(to the) direction of prayer|you will be pleased with.|So turn|your face|towards the direction|(of) the Al-Masjid Al-Haraam||and wherever|you are||[so] turn|your faces|(in) its direction.|And indeed,|those who|were given|the Book|surely know|that it|(is) the truth|from|their Lord.|And not|(is) Allah|unaware|of what|they do.
And even if|you come|(to) those who|were given|the Book|with all|(the) signs,|not|they would follow|your direction of prayer,|and not|(will) you (be)|a follower|(of) their direction of prayer.|And not|some of them|(are) followers|(of the) direction of prayer|(of each) other.|And if|you followed|their desires||after|[what]|came to you|of|the knowledge,|indeed, you|(would) then|(be) surely among|the wrongdoers.
(To) those whom|We gave [them]|the Book,|they recognize it|like|they recognize|their sons.|And indeed,|a group|of them|surely they conceal|the Truth|while they|know.
The Truth|(is) from|your Lord,|so (do) not|be|among|the doubters.
And for everyone|(is) a direction -|he|turns towards it,|so race|(to) the good.|Wherever||you will be||Allah will bring you||together.|Indeed,  Allah||(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And from|wherever|you start forth,|[so] turn|your face|(in the) direction|(of) Al-Masjid Al-Haraam.||And indeed, it|(is) surely the truth|from|your Lord.|And not|(is) Allah|unaware|of what|you do.
And from|wherever|you start forth|[so] turn|your face|(in the) direction|(of) Al-Masjid Al-Haraam.||And wherever|you (all) are||[so] turn|your faces|(in) its direction,|so that not|will be|for the people|against you|any argument|except|those who|wronged|among them;|so (do) not|fear them,|but fear Me.|And that I complete|My favor|upon you|[and] so that you may|(be) guided.
As|We sent|among you|a Messenger|from you|(who) recites|to you|Our verses|and purifies you|and teaches you|the Book|and the wisdom|and teaches you|what|not|you were|knowing.
So remember Me,|I will remember you|and be grateful|to Me|and (do) not be ungrateful to Me.|
O you|who|believe[d] |Seek help|through patience|and the prayer.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) with|the patient ones.
And (do) not say||for (the ones) who|are slain|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|"(They are) dead."|Nay,|(they are) alive|[and] but|you (do) not perceive.|
And surely We will test you|with something|of|[the] fear|and [the] hunger|and loss|of|[the] wealth|and [the] lives|and [the] fruits,|but give good news|(to) the patient ones.
Those who,|when|strikes them|a misfortune,|they say,|"Indeed, we belong to Allah||and indeed we|towards Him|will return."
Those|on them|(are) blessings|from|their Lord|and Mercy.|And those|[they]|(are) the guided ones.
Indeed,|the Safa|and the Marwah|(are) from (the) symbols||(of) Allah.|So whoever|performs Hajj|(of) the House|or|performs Umrah,|so no|blame|on him|that|he walks|between [both of] them.|And whoever|voluntarily does|good,|then indeed, Allah||(is) All-Appreciative,|All-Knowing.
Indeed,|those who|conceal|what|We revealed|of|the clear proofs,|and the Guidance,|after||[what] We made clear||to the people|in|the Book -|those,|Allah curses them||and curse them|the ones who curse.
Except|those|who repent[ed]|and reform[ed]|and openly declar[ed].|Then those,|I will accept repentance|from them,|and I (am)|the Acceptor of Repentance,|the Most Merciful.
Indeed, those who||disbelieve[d]|and die[d]|while they|(were) disbelievers,|those,|on them|(is the) curse|(of) Allah,|and the Angels,|and the mankind,|all together.
(Will) abide forever|in it.|Will not be lightened||for them|the punishment|and not|they|will be reprieved.
And your God|(is) one God;||(there is) no god||except|Him,|the Most Gracious,|the Most Merciful.
Indeed,|in|(the) creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and alternation|of the night|and the day,|and the ships|which|sail|in|the sea|with what|benefits|[the] people,|and what|Allah (has) sent down||from the sky||[of] water,||giving life|thereby|(to) the earth|after|its death,|and dispersing|therein|[of] every||moving creature,|and directing|(of) the winds|and the clouds|[the] controlled|between|the sky|and the earth,|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who use their intellect.
And among|the mankind|who|takes|besides||Allah|equals.|They love them|as (they should) love Allah.||And those who|believe[d]|(are) stronger|(in) love|for Allah.|And if|would see|those who|wronged,|when|they will see|the punishment|that|all the power belongs to Allah|||and [that] Allah||(is) severe|(in) [the] punishment.
When|will disown|those who|were followed|[from] those||who followed|and they will see|the punishment,|[and] will be cut off|for them|the relations.
And said|those who|followed,|"(Only) if [that]||for us|a return,|then we will disown|[from] them|as|they disown|[from] us."|Thus|Allah will show them||their deeds|(as) regrets|for them.|And not|they|will come out|from|the Fire.
O mankind ||Eat|of what|(is) in the earth -||lawful|(and) good.|And (do) not|follow|(the) footsteps (of)|the Shaitaan.|Indeed, he|(is) to you|an enemy|clear.
Only|he commands you|to (do) the evil|and the shameful|and that|you say|about|Allah|what|not|you know.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Follow|what|Allah has revealed,"||they said,|"Nay|we follow|what|we found|[on it]|our forefathers (following)".|Even though|[were]|their forefathers|(did) not understand||anything|and they were not guided?|
And (the) example|(of) those who|disbelieve[d]|(is) like (the) example|(of) the one who|shouts|at what|(does) not hear||except|calls|and cries -|deaf|dumb,|(and) blind,|[so] they|(do) not understand.|
O you who||believe[d] |Eat|from (the) good||what|We have provided you|and be grateful|to Allah|if|you|worship Him alone.|
Only|He has forbidden|to you|the dead animals,|and [the] blood,|and flesh,|(of) swine,|and what has been dedicated||[with it]|to other than|Allah.|So whoever|(is) forced by necessity|without|(being) disobedient|and not|transgressor,|then no|sin|on him.|Indeed, Allah||(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Indeed, those who||conceal|what  Allah (has) revealed|||of the Book,||and they purchase|there with|a gain|little.|Those,|not they eat||in their bellies||except|the Fire.|And Allah will not speak to them|||(on the) Day|(of) [the] Judgment|and He will not purify them,||and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
Those|(are) they who|purchase[d]|[the] astraying|for [the] Guidance,|and [the] punishment|for [the] forgiveness.|So what (is)|their endurance|on|the Fire
That|(is) because|Allah|revealed|the Book|with [the] Truth.|And indeed,|those|who differed|in|the Book|(are) surely in|schism|far.
It is not|[the] righteousness|that|you turn|your faces|towards|the east|and the west,|[and] but|the righteous[ness]|(is he) who|believes|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last,|and the Angels,|and the Book,|and the Prophets,|and gives|the wealth|in spite of his love (for it)||(to) the near relatives,||and the orphans,|and the needy,|and the wayfarer,|and those who ask,|and in|freeing the necks (slaves)|and (who) establish|the prayer,|and give|the zakah,|and those who fulfill|their covenant|when|they make it;|and those who are patient|in [the] suffering|and [the] hardship,||at (the) time|(of) [the] stress.|Those|(are) the ones who||are true|and those,|[they]|(are) the righteous .
O you|who|believe[d] |Prescribed|for you|(is) the legal retribution|in (the matter of) the murdered,||the freeman|for the freeman,|and the slave|for the slave,|and the female|for the female.|But whoever|is pardoned|[for it]|from his brother||anything,|then follows up|with suitable|[and] payment|to him|with kindness.|That (is)|a concession|from|your Lord|and mercy.|Then whoever|transgresses|after|that,|then for him|(is) a punishment|painful.
And for you|in the legal retribution||(is) life,|O men of understanding||So that you may|(become) righteous.
Prescribed|for you|when|approaches|any of you|[the] death,|if|he leaves|good|(making) the will|for the parents|and the near relatives|with due fairness|a duty|on|the righteous ones.
Then whoever|changes it|after what|he (has) heard [it],|so only|its sin|(would be) on|those who|alter it.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
But whoever|fears|from|(the) testator|(any) error|or|sin,|then reconciles|between them,|then (there is) no|sin|on him.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|All-Merciful.
O you|who|believe[d] |Is prescribed|for you|[the] fasting|as|was prescribed|to|those|before you,||so that you may|(become) righteous.
(Fasting for) days|numbered.|So whoever|among you is||sick|or|on|a journey,|then a prescribed number|of|days|other.|And on|those who|can afford it,|a ransom|(of) feeding|a poor.|And whoever|volunteers|good|then it|(is) better|for him.|And to|fast|(is) better|for you,|if|you|know.
Month|(of) Ramadhaan|(is) that|was revealed|therein|the Quran,|a Guidance|for mankind|and clear proofs|of|[the] Guidance|and the Criterion.|So whoever|witnesses|among you|the month,|then he should fast in it,|and whoever|is|sick|or|on|a journey|then prescribed number (should be made up)|from|days|other.|Allah intends||for you|[the] ease|and not|intends|for you|[the] hardship,|so that you complete|the prescribed period|and that you magnify|Allah|for|[what]|He guided you|so that you may|(be) grateful.
And when|ask you|My servants|about Me,|then indeed I am|near.|I respond|(to the) invocation|(of) the supplicant|when|he calls Me.|So let them respond to Me||and let them believe in Me,||so that they may|(be) led aright.
Permitted|for you|(in the) nights|(of) fasting|(is) the approach|to|your wives.|They|(are) garments|for you|and you|(are) garments|for them.|Allah knows||that you|used to|deceive|yourselves,|so He turned|towards you|and He forgave|[on] you.|So now|have relations with them|and seek|what|Allah has ordained||for you.|And eat|and drink|until|becomes distinct|to you|the thread|[the] white|from|the thread|[the] black|of|[the] dawn.|Then|complete|the fast|till|the night.|And (do) not have relations with them||while you|(are) secluded|in|the masajid.|These|(are the) limits (set by) Allah,||so (do) not|approach them.|Thus|Allah makes clear||His verses|for [the] people|so that they may|(become) righteous.
And (do) not eat||your properties|among yourselves|wrongfully|and present|[with] it|to|the authorities|so that you may eat|a portion|from|(the) wealth|(of) the people|sinfully|while you|know.
They ask you|about|the new moons.|Say,|"They|(are) indicators of periods|for the people,|and (for) the Hajj."|And it is not|[the] righteousness|that|you come|(to) the houses|from|their backs,|[and] but|[the] righteous|(is one) who|fears (Allah).|And come|(to) the houses|from|their doors.|And fear|Allah|so that you may|(be) successful.
And fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|those who|fight you|and (do) not transgress.||Indeed,|Allah|(does) not like||the transgressors.
And kill them|wherever|you find them,|and drive them out|from|wherever|they drove you out,|and [the] oppression|(is) worse|than|[the] killing.|And (do) not|fight them|near|Al-Masjid Al-Haraam||until|they fight you|in it.|Then if|they fight you,|then kill them.|Such|(is the) reward|(of) the disbelievers.
Then if|they cease,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And fight (against) them|until|(there) is no||oppression,|and becomes|the religion|for Allah|Then if|they cease|then (let there be) no|hostility|except|against|the oppressors.
The month|[the] sacred|(is) for the month|[the] sacred,|and for all the violations|(is) legal retribution.|Then whoever|transgressed|upon you|then you transgress|on him|in (the) same manner|(as)|he transgressed|upon you.|And fear|Allah|and know|that|Allah|(is) with|those who fear (Him).
And spend|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and (do) not|throw (yourselves)|[with your hands]|into|[the] destruction.|And do good;|indeed,|Allah|loves|the good-doers.
And complete|the Hajj|and the Umrah|for Allah.|And if|you are held back|then (offer) whatever|(can be) obtained with ease|of|the sacrificial animal.|And (do) not|shave|your heads|until|reaches|the sacrificial animal|(to) its destination.|Then whoever|is|among you|ill|or|he (has)|an ailment|of|his head|then a ransom|of|fasting|or|charity|or|sacrifice.|Then when|you are secure|then whoever|took advantage|of the Umrah|followed|(by) the Hajj,|then (offer) whatever|(can be) obtained with ease|of|the sacrificial animal.|But whoever|(can)not|find -|then a fast|(of) three|days|during|the Hajj|and seven (days)|when|you return.|This|(is) ten (days)|in all.|That|(is) for (the one) whose,|not|is|his family|present|(near) Al-Masjid Al-Haraam.||And fear Allah||and know|that|Allah|(is) severe|(in) retribution.
(For) the Hajj|(are) months|well known,|then whoever|undertakes|therein|the Hajj|then no|sexual relations|and no|wickedness|and no|quarrelling|during|the Hajj.|And whatever|you do|of|good|Allah knows it.||And take provision,|(but) indeed,|(the) best|provision|(is) righteousness.|And fear Me,|O men|(of) understanding
Not is|on you|any sin|that|you seek|bounty|from|your Lord.|And when|you depart|from|(Mount) Arafat|then remember|Allah|near|the Monument|[the] Sacred.|And remember Him|as|He (has) guided you,|[and] though|you were|[from]|before [it],|surely among|those who went astray.
Then|depart|from|wherever|depart|the people|and ask forgiveness|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|All-Merciful.
Then when|you complete[d]|your acts of worship|then remember|Allah|as you remember|your forefathers|or|(with) greater|remembrance.|And from|the people|who|say,|"Our Lord |Grant us|in|the world."|And not|for him|in|the Hereafter|[of]|any share.
And from those|who|say,|"Our Lord |Grant us|in|the world|good|and in|the Hereafter|good,|and save us|(from the) punishment|(of) the Fire."
Those -|for them|(is) a share|of what|they earned,|and Allah|(is) swift|(in taking) account.
And remember|Allah|during|days|numbered.|Then (he) who|hurries|in|two days|then no|sin|upon him,|and whoever|delays|then no|sin|upon him|for (the one) who|fears.|And fear|Allah|and know|that you|unto Him|will be gathered.
And of|the people|(is the one) who|pleases you|(with) his speech|in|the life|(of) the world,|and he calls to witness|Allah|on|what|(is) in|his heart,|and he|(is) the most quarrelsome of opponents.|
And when|he turns away|he strives|in|the earth|to spread corruption|[in it],|and destroys|the crops|and progeny.|And Allah|(does) not|love|[the] corruption.
And when|it is said|to him|"Fear|Allah,"|takes him|(his) pride|to [the] sins.|Then enough for him|(is) Hell -|[and] surely an evil|[the] resting-place.
And of|the people|(is the one) who|sells|his own self|seeking|pleasure|(of) Allah.|And Allah|(is) full of Kindness|to His servants.
O you|who|believe[d] |Enter|in|Islam|completely,|and (do) not|follow|footsteps|(of) the Shaitaan.|Indeed, he|(is) for you|an enemy|open.
Then if|you slip||after|[what]|came to you|(from) the clear proofs,|then know|that|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Are|they waiting|[except]|that|Allah comes to them||in (the) shadows||of|[the] clouds,|and the Angels,|and the matter is decreed?||And to|Allah|return|(all) the matters.
Ask|(the) Children|(of) Israel,|how many|We gave them|of|(the) clear Sign(s).||And whoever|changes|Favor|(of) Allah|after||[what]|it (has) come to him -|then indeed,|Allah|(is) severe|in [the] chastising.
Beautified|for those who|disbelieve[d]|(is) the life|(of) the world,|and they ridicule|[of]|those who|believe[d].|And those who|fear (Allah),|(they will be) above them|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection.|And Allah|provides|whom|He wills|without|measure.
Was|mankind|a community|single,|then Allah raised up||[the] Prophets|(as) bearers of glad tidings|and (as) warners,|and sent down|with them|the Book|in [the] truth|to judge|between|[the] people|in what|they differed|[in it].|And (did) not|differ[ed]|in it|except|those who|were given it|after||[what]|came to them|the clear proofs,|(out of) jealousy|among themselves.|And Allah guided||those who|believe[d]|regarding what|they differed|[in it]|of|the Truth|with His permission.|And Allah|guides|whom|He wills|to|a straight path.|
Or|(do) you think|that|you will enter|Paradise|while not|(has) come to you|like (came to)|those who|passed away|before you?||Touched them|[the] adversity|and [the] hardship,|and they were shaken|until|said|the Messenger|and those who|believed|with him,|"When|(will) Allah's help (come)?"||Unquestionably,|[Indeed]|help|(of) Allah|(is) near.
They ask you|what|they (should) spend.|Say,|"Whatever|you spend|of|good,|(is) for parents,|and the relatives,|and the orphans,|and the needy,|and the wayfarer.||And whatever|you do|of|good.|So indeed,|Allah|of it|(is) All-Aware.
Is prescribed|upon you|[the] fighting|while it|(is) hateful|to you.|But perhaps|[that]|you dislike|a thing|and it|(is) good|for you;|and perhaps|[that]|you love|a thing|and it|(is) bad|for you.|And Allah|knows|while you|(do) not know.|
They ask you|about|the month|[the] sacred -|(concerning) fighting|in it.|Say,|"Fighting|therein|(is) a great (sin);|but hindering (people)|from|(the) way|(of) Allah,|and disbelief|in Him|and (preventing access to) Al-Masjid Al-Haraam,||and driving out|its people|from it,|(is) greater (sin)|near|Allah.|And [the] oppression|(is) greater|than|[the] killing."|And not|they will cease|(to) fight with you|until|they turn you away|from|your religion,|if|they are able.|And whoever|turns away|among you|from|his religion,|then dies|while he|(is) a disbeliever|for those|became worthless|their deeds|in|the world|and the Hereafter.|And those|(are) companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and those who|emigrated|and strove|in|(the) way|(of) Allah -|those,|they hope|(for) Mercy|(of) Allah.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|All-Merciful.
They ask you|about|[the] intoxicants|and [the] games of chance|Say,|"In both of them|(is) a sin|great,|and (some) benefits|for [the] people.|But sin of both of them|(is) greater|than|(the) benefit of (the) two."|And they ask you|what|they (should) spend.|Say,|"The surplus."|Thus|Allah makes clear||to you|[the] Verses|so that you may|ponder,
Concerning|the world|and the Hereafter.|They ask you|about|the orphans.|Say,|"Setting right (their affairs)|for them|(is) best.|And if|you associate with them|then they (are) your brothers.|And Allah|knows|the corrupter|from|the amender.|And if|Allah (had) willed||surely He (could have) put you in difficulties.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise."
And (do) not|[you] marry|[the] polytheistic women|until|they believe.|And a believing bondwoman||(is) better|than|a polytheistic woman|[and] even if|she pleases you.|And (do) not|give in marriage (your women)|(to) [the] polytheistic men|until|they believe,|and a believing bondman||(is) better|than|a polytheistic man|[and] even if|he pleases you.|[Those]|they invite|to|the Fire,|and Allah|invites|to|Paradise|and [the] forgiveness|by His permission.|And He makes clear|His Verses|for the people|so that they may|take heed.
And they ask you|about|[the] menstruation.|Say,|"It|(is) a hurt,|so keep away (from)|[the] women|during|(their) [the] menstruation.|And (do) not|approach them|until|they are cleansed|Then when|they are purified,|then come to them|from|where|Allah has ordered you."||Indeed,|Allah|loves|those who turn in repentance|and loves|those who purify themselves.
Your wives|(are) a tilth|for you,|so come|(to) your tilth|when|you wish,|and send forth (good deeds)|for yourselves.|And be conscious (of) Allah||and know|that you|(will) meet Him.|And give glad tidings|(to) the believers.
And (do) not|make|Allah's (name)|an excuse|in your oaths|that|you do good,|and be righteous|and make peace|between|[the] people.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Not|will Allah take you to task||for (what is) unintentional|in|your oaths,|[and] but|He takes you to task|for what|(have) earned|your hearts.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Forbearing.
For those who|swear (off)|from|their wives|(is a) waiting (of)|four|months,|then if|they return -|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And if|they resolve|(on) [the] divorce -|then indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
And the women who are divorced|shall wait|concerning themselves|(for) three|monthly periods.|And (it is) not|lawful|for them|that|they conceal|what|Allah (has) created||in|their wombs,|if|they|believe|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last.|And their husbands|(have) better right|to take them back|in|that (period)|if|they wish|(for) reconciliation.|And for them (wives)|(is) the like|(of) that which|(is) on them|in a reasonable manner,|and for the men|over them (wives)|(is) a degree.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
The divorce|(is) twice.|Then to retain|in a reasonable manner|or|to release (her)|with kindness.|And (it is) not|lawful|for you|that|you take (back)|whatever|you have given them (wives)|anything,|except|if|both fear|that not|they both (can) keep|(the) limits of Allah.||But if|you fear|that not|they both (can) keep|(the) limits of Allah||then (there is) no|sin|on both of them|in what|she ransoms|concerning it.|These|(are the) limits of Allah,||so (do) not|transgress them.|And whoever|transgresses|(the) limits of Allah||then those -|they|the wrongdoers.
Then if|he divorces her,|then (she is) not|lawful|for him|after (that)||until|she marries|a spouse|other than him.|Then if|he divorces her|then no|sin|on them|if|they return to each other|if|they believe|that|they (will be able to) keep|(the) limits of Allah.||And these|(are the) limits of Allah.||He makes them clear|to a people|who know.
And when|you divorce|the women|and they reach|their (waiting) term,|then retain them|in a fair manner|or|release them|in a fair manner.|And (do) not|retain them|to hurt|so that you transgress.|And whoever|does|that,|then indeed,|he wronged|himself.|And (do) not|take|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|(in) jest,|and remember|(the) Favors of Allah||upon you|and what|(is) revealed|to you|of|the Book|and [the] wisdom;|He instructs you|with it.|And fear Allah||and know|that|Allah (is)|of every|thing|All-Knower.
And when|you divorce|[the] women|and they reached|their (waiting) term,|then (do) not|hinder them|from [that]|marrying|their husbands|when|they agree|between themselves|in a fair manner.|That|is admonished|with it|whoever|[is]|among you|believes|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last;|that|(is) more virtuous|for you|and more purer.|And Allah|knows|and you|(do) not know.|
And the mothers|shall suckle|their children|(for) two years|complete,|for whoever|wishes|to|complete|the suckling.|And upon|the father|(is) their provision||and their clothing|in a fair manner.|Not|is burdened|any soul|except|its capacity|Not|made to suffer|(the) mother|because of her child|and not|(the) father|because of his child.||And on|the heirs|(is a duty) like|that.|Then if|they both desire|weaning|through|mutual consent|of both of them|and consultation,|then no|blame|on both of them.|And if|you want|to ask another women to suckle||your child|then (there is) no|blame|on you,|when|you pay|what|(is) due (from) you|in a fair manner.|And fear Allah||and know|that|Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
And those who|pass away|among you|and leave behind|wives,|(the widows) should wait for themselves||(for) four|months|and ten (days).|Then when|they reach|their (specified) term,|then (there is) no|blame|upon you|for what|they do|concerning themselves||in a fair manner.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Aware.
And (there is) no|blame|upon you|in what|you hint|[with it] of||marriage proposal|[to] the women|or|you concealed it|in|yourselves.|Allah knows||that you|will mention them,|[and] but|(do) not|promise them (widows)|secretly|except|that|you say|a saying|honorable.|And (do) not|resolve (on)|the marriage knot||until|reaches|the prescribed term|its end.|And know|that|Allah|knows|what|(is) within|yourselves|so beware of Him.|And know|that|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Forbearing.
(There is) no|blame|upon you|if|you divorce|[the] women|whom|you have not touched||nor|you specified|for them|an obligation (dower).|And make provision for them -|upon|the wealthy|according to his means|and upon|the poor|according to his means -|a provision|in a fair manner,|a duty|upon|the good-doers.
And if|you divorce them|before||[that]|you (have) touched them|while already|you have specified|for them|an obligation (dower),|then (give) half|(of) what|you have specified,|unless|[that]|they (women) forgo (it)|or|forgoes|the one|in whose hands|(is the) knot|(of) the marriage.|And that|you forgo,|(is) nearer|to [the] righteousness.|And (do) not|forget|the graciousness|among you.|Indeed,|Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
Guard strictly|[on]|the prayers,|and the prayer -|[the] middle,|and stand up|for Allah|devoutly obedient.
And if|you fear|then (pray) on foot|or|riding.|Then when|you are secure|then remember|Allah|as|He (has) taught you|what|you were not||knowing.
And those who|they die|among you|and leave behind|(their) wives|(should make) a will|for their wives,|provision|for|the year|without|driving (them) out.|But if|they leave|then no|blame|upon you|in|what|they do|concerning|themselves|[of]|honorably.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
And for the divorced women,|(is) a provision|in a fair manner -|a duty|upon|the righteous.
Thus|Allah makes clear||for you|His Verses|so that you may|use your intellect.
Did you not see||[to]|those who|went out|from|their homes|and they|(were in) thousands|(in) fear|(of) [the] death?|Then said|to them|Allah,|"Die;"|then|He restored them to life.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) surely Possessor of bounty||for|[the] mankind|[and] but|most|(of) the people|are not grateful.|
And fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|and know|that|Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Who|(is) the one who||will lend|(to) Allah -|a loan|good,|so (that) He multiplies it|for him -|manifolds||And Allah|withholds|and grants abundance,|and to Him|you will be returned.
Did you not see||[towards]|the chiefs|of|(the) Children|(of) Israel|after||Musa,|when|they said|to a Prophet|of theirs,|"Appoint|for us|a king,|we may fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah?"|He said,|"Would|you perhaps -|if|prescribed|upon you|[the] fighting,|that not|you fight?"|They said,|"And what|for us|that not|we fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|while surely|we have been driven out|from|our homes|and our children?"|Yet, when|was prescribed|upon them|the fighting|they turned away,|except|a few|among them.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing|of the wrongdoers.
And said|to them|their Prophet,|"Indeed,|Allah|(has) surely|raised|for you|Talut|(as) a king."|They said,|How can be||for him|the kingship|over us,|while we|(are) more entitled|to kingship|than him,|and he has not been given||abundance|of|[the] wealth?"|He said,|"Indeed,|Allah|has chosen him|over you|and increased him|abundantly|in|[the] knowledge|and [the] physique.|And Allah|gives|His kingdom|(to) whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing."
And said|to them|their Prophet,|"Indeed,|a sign|(of) his kingship|(is) that|will come to you|the ark,|in it|(is) a tranquility|from|your Lord,|and a remnant|of what|(was) left|(by the) family|(of) Musa|and family|(of) Harun|will carry it|the Angels.|Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a sign|for you|if|you are|believers."
Then when|set out|Talut|with the forces|he said,|"Indeed,|Allah|will test you|with a river.|So whoever|drinks|from it|then he is not|from me,|and whoever|(does) not|taste it|then indeed, he|(is) from me|except|whoever|takes|(in the) hollow|(of) his hand."|Then they drank|from it|except|a few|of them.|Then when|he crossed it||and those who|believed|with him,|they said,|"No|strength|for us|today|against Jalut|and his troops."|Said|those who|were certain|that they|(would) meet|Allah,|"How many|of|a small company||overcame|a large company||by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|And Allah|(is) with|the patient ones."
And when|they went forth|to (face) Jalut|and his troops|they said,|"Our Lord |Pour|on us|patience|and make firm|our feet,|and help us|against|the disbelieving people."|
So they defeated them|by (the) permission|of Allah,|and killed|Dawood|Jalut,|and Allah gave him||the kingdom|and the wisdom|and taught him|that which|He willed.|And if not|(for) Allah's repelling||[the] people -|some of them|with others,|certainly the earth (would have been) corrupted,||[and] but|Allah|(is) Possessor of bounty||to|the worlds.
These|(are the) Verses|(of) Allah,|We recite them|to you|in [the] truth.|And indeed, you|(are) surely of|the Messengers.
These (are) the Messengers||We (have) preferred|some of them|over|others.|Among them|(were those to) who(m)|Allah spoke,||and He raised|some of them|(in) degrees.|And We gave|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|the clear proofs|and We supported him|with Spirit|[the] Holy.|And if|Allah (had) willed||(would have) not fought each other||those who||(came) after them,||after|[what]|came to them|clear proofs.|[And] but|they differed,|[so] of them|(are) some who|believed|and of them|(are) some who|denied.|And if|Allah (had) willed||they (would have) not fought each other,||[and] but|Allah|does|what|He intends.
O you|who|believe[d] |Spend|of what|We (have) provided you,||before|[that]|comes|a Day|no|bargaining|in it|and no|friendship|and no|intercession.|And the deniers -|they|(are) the wrongdoers.
Allah -|(there is) no|God|except|Him,|the Ever-Living,|the Sustainer of all that exists.|Not|overtakes Him|slumber|[and] not|sleep.|To Him (belongs)|what(ever)|(is) in|the heavens|and what(ever)|(is) in|the earth.|Who|(is) that who||intercedes|with Him|except|by His permission.|He knows|what|(is) before them||and what|(is) behind them.|And not|they encompass|anything|of|His Knowledge|except|[of] what|He willed.|Extends|His Throne|(to) the heavens|and the earth.|And not|tires Him|the guarding of (both of) them.|And He|(is) the Most High,|the Most Great.
(There is) no|compulsion|in|the religion.|Surely|became distinct|the right (path)|from|the wrong.|Then whoever|disbelieves|in false deities|and believes|in Allah,|then surely|he grasped|the handhold -|[the] firm,|(which will) not break||[for it].|And Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Allah|(is) the Protecting Guardian|of those who|believe[d].|He brings them out|from|[the] darkness|towards|[the] light.|And those who|disbelieve(d)|their guardians|(are)  the evil ones,|they bring them out|from|the light|towards|[the] darkness.|Those|(are) the companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|will abide forever.
Did not|you see|[towards]|the one who|argued|(with) Ibrahim|concerning|his Lord,|because|Allah gave him||the kingdom?|When|Ibrahim said,||'My  Lord|(is) the One Who|grants life|and causes death.'|He said,|'I|give life|and cause death.'|Said|Ibrahim,|'[Then] indeed|Allah|brings up|the sun|from|the East,|so you bring|it|from|the West'.|So became dumbfounded|the one who|disbelieved,|and Allah|(does) not|guide|the people|(who are) [the] wrongdoers.
Or|like the one who|passed|by|a township,|and it|(had) overturned|on|its roofs.|He said,|'How|(will) bring to life|this (town)|Allah|after|its death?'|Then Allah caused him to die||(for) a hundred|year(s),|then|He raised him.|He said,|'How long|(have) you remained?'|He said,|'I remained|(for) a day|or|a part|(of) a day.'|He said,|'Nay,|you (have) remained|one hundred|year(s).|Then look|at|your food|and your drink,|(they did) not|change with time,|and look|at|your donkey,|and We will make you|a sign|for the people.|And look|at|the bones|how|We raise them,|then|We cover them|(with) flesh.'|Then when|became clear|to him|he said,|'I know|that|Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.'
And when|said|Ibrahim,|'My Lord|show me|how|You give life|(to) the dead.'|He said,|'Have not|you believed?'|He said,|'Yes|[and] but|to satisfy|my heart.'|He said|'Then take|four|of|the birds|and incline them|towards you,|then|put|on|each|hill|a portion of them;||then|call them,|they will come to you|(in) haste.|And know|that|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Example|(of) those who|spend|their wealth|in|the way|(of) Allah,|(is) like|a grain|(which) grows|seven|ears,|in|each|ear|hundred|grain(s).|And Allah|gives manifold|to whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.
Those who|spend|their wealth|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|then|not|they follow|what|they spend|(with) reminder of generosity|and not|hurt -|for them|their reward|(is) with|their Lord,|and (there will be) no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
A word|kind|and (seeking) forgiveness|(are) better|than|a charity|followed [it]|(by) hurt.|And Allah|(is) All-Sufficient,|All-Forbearing.
O you|who|believe[d] |(Do) not|render in vain|your charities|with reminders (of it)|or [the] hurt,|like the one who|spends|his wealth|to be seen|(of) the people,|and (does) not|believe|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last.|Then his example|(is) like that|(of) the smooth rock|upon it|(is) dust,|then fell on it|heavy rain,|then left it|bare.|Not|they have control|on|anything|of what|they (have) earned.|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people|[the] disbelieving.
And the example|of those who|spend|their wealth|seeking|(the) pleasure|(of) Allah,|and certainty|from|their (inner) souls,|(is) like|a garden|on a height,|fell on it|heavy rain|so it yielded|its harvest|double.|Then if|(does) not|fall (on) it|heavy rain,|then a drizzle.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
Would like|any of you|that|it be|for him|a garden,|of|date-palms|and grapevines|flowing|[from]|underneath it|the rivers,|for him|in it|of|all (kinds)|of [the] fruits,|and falls on him|[the] old age|and [for him] (his)|children|(are) weak|then falls on it|whirlwind,|in it|(is) fire|then it is burnt.|Thus|Allah makes clear||for you|(His) Signs|so that you may|ponder.
O you|who|believe[d] |Spend|from|the good things|that|you have earned|and whatever|We brought forth|for you|from|the earth.|And (do) not|aim at|the bad|of it|you spend,|while you (would) not|take it|except|[that]|(with) close(d) eyes|[in it],|and know|that|Allah|(is) Self-Sufficient,|Praiseworthy.
The Shaitaan|promises you|[the] poverty|and orders you|to immorality,|while Allah|promises you|forgiveness|from Him|and bounty.|And Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.
He grants|[the] wisdom|(to) whom|He wills,|and whoever|(is) granted|[the] wisdom,|then certainly|he is granted|good|abundant.|And none|remembers|except|the people of understanding.|
And whatever|you spend|(out) of|(your) expenditures|or|you vow|of|vow(s),|then indeed,|Allah|knows it,|and not|for the wrongdoers|any|helpers.
If|you disclose|the charities|then well|it (is).|But if|you keep it secret|and give it|(to) the poor,|then it|(is) better|for you.|And He will remove|from you|[of]|your evil deeds.|And Allah|with what|you do|(is) All-Aware.
Not|on you|(is) their guidance|[and] but|Allah|guides|whom|He wills.|And whatever|you spend|of|good|then it is for yourself,|and not|you spend|except|seeking|(the) face of Allah.||And whatever|you spend|of|good,|will be repaid in full|to you|and you|(will) not|be wronged.
For the poor,|those who|are wrapped up|in|the way|of Allah,|not|they (are) able|(to) move about|in|the earth.|Think (about) them,|the ignorant one,|(that they are) self-sufficient|(because) of|[the] (their) restraint,|you recognize them|by their mark.|They (do) not ask||the people|with importunity.|And whatever|you spend|of|good,|then indeed,|Allah|of it|(is) All-Knower.
Those who|spend|their wealth|by night|and day|secretly|and openly,|then for them|(is) their reward|with|their Lord,|and no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
Those who|consume|[the] usury|not|they can stand|except|like|stands|the one who,|confounds him|the Shaitaan|with|his touch.|That|(is) because they|say,|'Only|the trade|(is) like|[the] usury.'|While Allah has permitted||[the] trade|but (has) forbidden|[the] usury.|Then whoever -|comes to him|(the) admonition|from|His Lord|and he refrained,|then for him|what|(has) passed,|[and] his case|(is) with|Allah,|and whoever|repeated|then those|(are) the companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|will abide forever.
Allah destroys||the usury|and (gives) increase|(for) the charities.|And Allah|(does) not|love|every|ungrateful|sinner.
Indeed,|those who|believe[d]|and did|good deeds|and established|the prayer|and gave|the zakah|for them -|their reward|(is) with|their Lord,|and no|Fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
O you|who|believe[d] |Fear|Allah|and give up|what|remained|of|[the] usury,|if|you are|believers.
And if|not|you do,|then be informed|of a war|from|Allah|and His Messenger.|And if|you repent|then for you|(are) you capital-||(do) not|wrong|and not|you will be wronged.
And if|is|the (debtor) in difficulty,||then postponement|until|ease.|And if|you remit as charity|(it is) better|for you.|If|you|know.
And fear|a Day|you will be brought back|[in it]|to|Allah.|Then|(will be) repaid in full|every|soul|what|it  earned|and they|will not be wronged.|
O you|who|believe[d] |When|you contract with one another|any debt|for|a fixed term||then write it.|And let write|between you|a scribe|in justice.|And not|(should) refuse|a scribe|that|he writes|as|Allah (has) taught him.||So let him write|and let dictate|the one|on whom|(is) the right|and let him fear|Allah,|his Lord,|and (let him) not|diminish|from it|anything.|Then if|is|the one|on him|(is) the right|(of) limited understanding,|or|weak,|or|not|capable|that|he (can) dictate,||then let dictate|his guardian|with justice.|And call for  evidence|two witnesses|among|your men.|And if|not|(there) are|two men|then one man|and two women|of whom|you agree|of|[the] witnesses,|(so) that (if)|[she] errs,|one of the two,|then will remind|one of the two|(to) the other.|And not|(should) refuse|the witnesses|when|they are called.||And not|(be) weary|that|you write it -|small|or|large|for|its term.|That|(is) more just|near|Allah,|and more upright|for evidence|and nearer|that not|you (have) doubt,|except|that|be|a transaction|present,|you carry out|among you,|then not|on you|any sin|that not|you write it.|And take witness|when|you make commercial transaction.|And not|harm be done|(to) scribe|and not|(to) witness,|and if|you do,|then indeed it|(is) sinful conduct|for you,|and fear|Allah.|And Allah teaches you.||And Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
And if|you are|on|a journey|and not|you find|a scribe,|then pledge|in hand.|Then if|entrusts|one of you|to another|then let discharge|the one who|is entrusted|his trust.|And let him fear|Allah,|his Lord.|And (do) not|conceal|the evidence.|And whoever|conceals it,|then indeed he|(is) sinful -|his heart.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Knower.
To Allah (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And if|you disclose|what|(is) in|yourselves|or|you conceal it,|will call you to account|for it|Allah.|Then, He will forgive|[to] whom|He wills,|and He will punish|whom|He wills.|And Allah|on|every|thing|(is) All-Powerful.
Believed|the Messenger|in what|was revealed|to him|from|his Lord|and the believers.|All|believed|in Allah,|and His Angels,|and His Books,|and His Messengers.|'Not|we make distinction|between|any|of|His Messengers.'|And they said,|'We heard|and we obeyed.|(Grant us) your forgiveness|our Lord,|and to You|(is) the return.'
(Does) not|burden Allah||any soul|except|its capacity,|for it|what|it earned,|and against it|what|it earned.|'Our Lord |(Do) not|take us to task|if|we forget|or|we err.|Our Lord |And (do) not|lay|upon us|a burden|like that|(which) You laid [it]|on|those who|(were) before us.||Our Lord |[And] (do) not|lay on us|what|not|(the) strength|we have|[of it] (to bear).|And pardon|[from] us,|and forgive|[for] us|and have mercy on us.|You are|our Protector,|so help us|against|the people -|[the] disbelievers.
Alif Laam Meem
Allah -|(there is) no|God|except|Him,|the Ever-Living|the Sustainer of all that exists.
(He) revealed|to you|the Book|in [the] truth|confirming|that which|(was) before it,||and He revealed|the Taurat|and the Injeel,
Before (this),||(as) guidance|for the mankind.|And (He) revealed|the Criterion.|Verily,|those who|disbelieve[d]|in the Verses of Allah,||for them|(is) a punishment|severe.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Able of retribution.|
Indeed|Allah -|not|is hidden|from Him|anything|in|the earth|and not|in|the heaven.
He|(is) the One Who|shapes you|in|the wombs|how(ever)|He wills.|(There is) no|god|except|Him,|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
He|(is) the One Who|revealed|to you|the Book,|of it|(are) Verses|absolutely clear -|they are|the foundation|(of) the Book,|and others|(are) allegorical.|Then as for|those|in|[their] (whose) hearts|(is) perversity -|[so] they  follow|what|(is) allegory|of it,|seeking|[the] discord|and seeking|its interpretation.|And none|knows|its interpretation|except|Allah.|And those firm|in|[the] knowledge,|they say,|'We believe|in it.|All|from||our Lord.'|And none|will get admonished|except|men of understanding.|
'Our Lord |(Do) not|deviate|our hearts|after|[when]|You (have) guided us,|and grant|(for) us|from|Yourself|mercy.|Indeed You,|You|(are) the Bestower.
Our Lord |Indeed, You|will gather|[the] mankind|(on) a Day|(there is) no|doubt|in it.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|break|the Promise.'
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve[d]|never|will avail|[for] them|their wealth|and not|their children|against|Allah|anything,|and those -|they (are)|the fuel|(for) the Fire
Like behavior|(of the ) people|(of) Firaun|and those who|(were) before them.||They denied|Our Signs,|so Allah seized them||for their sins.|And Allah|(is) severe|(in) [the] punishment.
Say|to those who|disbelieve[d],|'You will be overcome|and you will be gathered|to|Hell,|[and] an evil|[the] resting place.
Surely|(it) was|for you|a sign|in|(the) two hosts|which met -|one group|fighting|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and another|disbelievers.|They were seeing them|twice of them|with their eyes.||And Allah|supports|with His help|whom|He wills.|Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a lesson|for the owners|of [the] vision.
[It is] beautified|for [the] mankind|love|(of) the (things they) desire -|of|[the] women|and [the] sons|and [the] heaps|[the] stored up|of|[the] gold|and [the] silver,|and [the] horses|[the] branded|and [the] cattle|and [the] tilled land.|That|(is) possession|(of) [the] life|of the world|but Allah has|with Him|(an) excellent|[the] abode to return.
Say,|'Shall I inform you|of better|than|that.|For those who|fear[ed],|with|their Lord,|(are) Gardens|flows|from|underneath them|[the] rivers -|abiding forever|in it,|and spouses|pure|and approval|from|Allah.|And Allah|(is) All-Seer|of (His) slaves.
Those who|say,|'Our Lord |Indeed, we|(have) believed,|so forgive|for us|our sins|and save us|(from) punishment|(of) the Fire.'
The patient|and the truthful|and the obedient|and those who spend|and those who seek forgiveness|[in the] before dawn.
Allah bears witness||that [He],|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|and (so do) the Angels,|and owners|of [the] knowledge -|standing|in justice.|(There is) no|god|except|Him,|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
Indeed,|the religion|near|Allah|is [the] Islam.|And not|(did) differ|those who|were given|the Book|except|after||what|came to them|[the] knowledge|out of envy|among them.|And whoever|disbelieves|in the Verses|of Allah,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) swift|(in taking) account.
Then if|they argue with you,|then say,|'I have submitted|myself|to Allah|and (those) who|follow me.'|And say|to those who|were given|the Book,|and the unlettered people,|'Have you submitted yourselves?'|Then if|they submit|then surely|they are guided.|But if|they turn back|then only|on you|(is) to [the] convey.|And Allah|(is) All-Seer|of [His] slaves.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|in the Signs of|Allah|and they kill|the Prophets|without|right|and they kill|those who|order|[with] justice|among|the people,|then give them tidings|of a punishment|painful.
Those (are)|(are) the ones who -|became worthless|their deeds|in|the world|and (in) the Hereafter.|And not|(will be) for them|any|helpers.
Have you not seen||[to]|those who|were given|a portion|of|the Scripture?|They are invited|to|the Book|(of) Allah|that (it should) arbitrate|between them,|then|turns away|a party|of them|and they (are)|those who are averse.
That|(is) because they|say,|'Never|will touch us|the Fire|except|(for) days|numbered.'|And deceived them|in|their religion|what|they were|inventing.
Then how (will it be)|when|We will gather them|on a Day -|no|doubt|in it.|And will be paid in full|every|soul|what|it earned|and they|not|will be wronged.
Say|'O Allah |Owner|(of) the Dominion,|You give|the dominion|(to) whom|You will|and You take away|the dominion|from whom|You will,|and You honor|whom|You will,|and You humiliate|whom|You will.|In Your hand|(is) all the good.|Indeed, You|(are) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
You cause to enter|the night|in|the day|and You cause to enter|the day|in|the night,|and You bring forth|the living|from|the dead,|and You bring forth|the dead|from|the living,|and You give provision|(to) whom|You will|without|measure.'
(Let) not|take|the believers,|the disbelievers|(as) allies|instead of||the believers.|And whoever|does|that,|then he is not|from|Allah|in|anything|except|that|you fear|from them|(as) a precaution.|And Allah warns you||(of) Himself,|and to|Allah|(is) the destination.
Say,|'Whether|you conceal|what|(is) in|your breasts|or|you disclose it -|Allah knows it.||And He knows|what|(is) in|the heavens|and what|(is) in|the earth.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.'
(On the) day|will find|every|soul|what|it did|of|good -|presented,|and what|it did|of|evil,|it will wish|[if]|that|between itself|and between it (evil)|(was) a great distance.||And Allah warns you||(against) Himself,|and Allah|(is) Most Kind|to (His) [the] slaves.
Say,|'If|you|love|Allah,|then follow me,|Allah will love you||and He will forgive|for you|your sins.|And Allah|(is) Most Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Say,|'Obey|Allah|and the Messenger.'|Then if|they turn away -|then indeed,|Allah|(does) not love||the disbelievers.
Indeed,|Allah|chose|Adam|and Nuh,|and the family|of Ibrahim|and the family|(of) Imran|over|the worlds.
Descendents,|some of them|from|others.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
When|[she] said|the wife|of Imran,|'My Lord |Indeed, I|[I] vowed|to You|what|(is) in|my womb,|dedicated,|so accept|from me.|Indeed, You,|You Alone|(are) the All-Hearing,|the All-Knowing.
Then when|she delivered her,|she said,|'My Lord,|indeed I|[I] (have) delivered [it]|a female.'|And Allah|knows better|[of] what|she delivered,|and (is) not|the male|like the female.|'And that I|[I] (have) named her|Maryam|and that I|[I] seek refuge (for) her|with You|and her offspring|from|the Shaitaan|the rejected.'
So accepted her,|her Lord|with acceptance|good,|and reared her -|a rearing|good,|and put her in the care|(of) Zakariya.|Whenever|entered|Zakariya in her||[the] prayer chamber|he found|with her|provision.|He said,|'O Maryam |From where|for you|(is) this?'|She said,|'This|(is) from||Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|gives provision|(to) whom|He wills|without|measure.'
There only,|Zakariya invoked||his Lord,|he said,|'My Lord|grant|[for] me|from|Yourself|offspring|pure.|Indeed, You|(are) All-Hearer|(of) the prayer
Then called him|the Angels|when he|(was) standing -|praying|in|the prayer chamber.|'Indeed,|Allah|gives you glad tidings|of Yahya,|confirming|of a Word|from|Allah|and a noble|and chaste|and a Prophet|among|the righteous.
He said,|'My Lord|how|is (it)|for me|a son,|and verily|has reached me|[the] old age|and my wife|(is) [a] barren?'|He said,|'Thus;|Allah|does|what|He wills.'
He said,|'My Lord|make|for me|a sign.'|He said,|your sign|(is) that not|you will speak|(to) the people|(for) three|days|except|(with) gestures.|And remember|your Lord|much,|and glorify (Him)|in the evening|and (in) the morning.'
And when|said|the Angels,|'O Maryam |Indeed,|Allah|(has) chosen you|and purified you|and chosen you|over|(the) women|(of) the worlds.'
'O Maryam |Be obedient|to your Lord|and prostrate|and bow down|with|those who bow down.'
That|(is) from|(the) news|(of) the unseen -|We reveal [it]|to you.|And not|you were|with them|when|they cast|their pens|(as to) which of them|takes charge of|Maryam;|and not|you were|with them|when|they (were) disputing.
When|said|the Angels,|'O Maryam |Indeed,|Allah|gives you glad tidings|of a word|from Him,|his name|(is) the Messiah,|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|honored|in|the world|and (in) the Hereafter,|and of|those brought near (to Allah).
And he will speak|(to) the people|in|the cradle|and (in) maturity;|and (he will be) of|the righteous.'
She said,|'My Lord|how|is [it]|for me|a boy,|and (has) not|touch(ed) me|any man?'|He said,|'Thus|Allah|creates|what|He wills.|When|He decrees|a matter|then only|He says|to it,|'Be,'|and it becomes.
And He will teach him|the Book,|and [the] wisdom,|and the Taurat,|and the Injeel.
And (make him) a Messenger|to|(the) Children|(of) Israel,|'Indeed, I|[surely]|[I] (have) come (to) you|with a sign|from|your Lord|that I|[I] design|for you|from|[the] clay|like the form|of the bird,|then I will breath|into it|and it would become|a bird|by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|And I cure|the blind,|and the leper,|and I give life|(to) the dead|by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|And I inform you|of what|you eat|and what|you store|in|your houses.|Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a sign|for you,|if|you are|believers.
And confirming|that which|(was) before me||of|the Taurat,|and so that I make lawful|for you|some|(of) that which|(was) forbidden|to you.|And I (have) come [to] you|with a sign|from|your Lord.|So fear|Allah|and obey me.
Indeed,|Allah|(is) my Lord|and your Lord,|so worship Him.|This|(is) the straight path.''|
Then when|perceived|Isa|from them|[the] disbelief|he said,|'Who|(will be) my helpers|to|Allah.'|Said|the disciples|'We|(will be the) helpers|(of) Allah,|we believe[d]|in Allah|and bear witness|that we|(are) Muslims.
Our  Lord,|we believe[d]|in what|You revealed|and we follow[ed]|the Messenger,|then write us|among|the witnesses.'
And they schemed,|and Allah planned.||And Allah|(is) the best|(of) the planners.
When|Allah said||'O Isa |Indeed, I|(will) take you|and raise you|to Myself|and purify you|from|those who|disbelieve[d],|and I will make|those who|follow[ed] you|superior|(to) those who|disbelieve[d]|till|(the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection.|Then|to Me|(is) your return|and I will judge|between you|about what|you were|[in it]|differing.
Then as for|those who|disbelieve[d],|then I will punish them|(with) a punishment|severe|in|the world|and (in) the Hereafter.|And not|for them|[of]|(any) helpers.
And as for|those who|believe[d]|and did|[the] righteous-deeds|then He will grant them  in full|their reward.|And Allah|(does) not|love|the wrongdoers.
That|(is what) We recite [it]|to you|of|the Verses|and the Reminder -|[the] Wise.
Indeed,|(the) likeness|(of) Isa|near|Allah|(is) like (the)  likeness|(of) Adam.|He created him|from|dust|then|He said|to him,|'Be,'|and he was.
The truth|(is) from|your Lord,|so (do) not|be|among|the doubters.
Then whoever|argues (with) you|concerning  it|after||what|came to you|of|the knowledge|then say,|'Come,|let us call|our sons|and your sons,|and our women|and your women,|and ourselves|and yourselves,|then|let us pray humbly,|and [we] invoke|the curse|(of) Allah|on|the liars.
Indeed,|this|[surely it] is|the narration -|[the] true.|And (there is) no god|||except|Allah.|And indeed,|Allah,|surely He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
And if|they turn back,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knowing,|of the corrupters.
Say,|'O People|of the Book |Come|to|a word|equitable|between us|and between you -|that not|we worship|except|Allah,|and not|we associate partners|with Him -|anything.|And not|take|some of us|(to) others|(as) lords||besides Allah.'||Then if|they turn away,|then say,|'Bear witness|that we|(are) Muslims.'
O People|of the Book |Why|(do) you argue|concerning|Ibrahim|while not|was revealed|the Taurat|and the Injeel|except|after him?||Then why don't|you use your intellect?
Here you are -|those who|argued|about what|[for] you|of it|(have some) knowledge.|Then why|(do) you argue|about what|not|for you|of it|(any) knowledge.|And Allah|knows,|while you|(do) not|know.
Not|was|Ibrahim|a Jew|and not|a Christian|and but|he was|a true|Muslim,|and not|he was|from|the polytheists.
Indeed,|the best people to claim relationship||with Ibrahim|(are) those who|follow him|and this|[the] Prophet|and those who|believe[d].|And Allah|(is) a Guardian|(of) the believers.
Wished|a group|from|(the) People|(of) the Book|if|they could lead you astray,|and not|they lead astray|except|themselves|and not|they perceive.
O People|of the Book |Why do|you deny|[in] the Signs|(of) Allah|while you|bear witness.
O People|of the Book |Why|do you mix|the truth|with the falsehood|and conceal|the truth|while you|know.
And said|a group|of|the People|(of) the Book,|'Believe|in what|was revealed|on|those who|believe[d]|at (the) beginning|(of) the day,|and reject|at its end,|perhaps they|(may) return.
And (do) not|believe|except|(the) one who|follows|your religion.'|Say,|'Indeed|the (true) guidance|(is) the Guidance of Allah -||lest|is given|(to) one -|the like|(of) what|was given to you|or|they may argue with you|near|your Lord.'|Say,|'Indeed,|the Bounty|(is) in the Hand of Allah.||He gives it|to whom|He wills,|and Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.'
He chooses|for His Mercy|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) the Possessor  of Bounty -||[the] great.
And from|the People|of the Book|(is he) who,|if|you entrust him|with a great amount of wealth|he will return it|to you.|And from them|(is he) who,|if|you entrust him|with a single coin|not|will he return it|to you|except|you keep constantly||over him|standing.|That|(is) because they|said,|'Not|on us|concerning  the unlettered people||any [way] (accountability).'|And they say|about|Allah|the lie|while they|know.
Nay,|whoever|fulfills|his covenant|and fears (Allah) ,|then indeed,|Allah|loves|those who fear (Him).
Indeed,|those who|exchange|(the) Covenant|(of) Allah|and their oaths|(for) a price|little,|those -|no|share|for them|in|the Hereafter|and not|will Allah speak to them,||and not|look|at them|on the Day|of the Resurrection|and not|purify them,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
And indeed,|among them|surely (is) a group -|they distort|their tongues|in (reciting) the Book|so that you may think it|(is) from|the Book|and not|it|(is) from|the Book.|And they say,|'It|(is) from Allah.'|||But not|it|(is) from Allah.|||And they say|about|Allah|the lie|while they|know.
Not|is|for a human|that|Allah gives him||the Book,|and the wisdom,|and the Prophethood,|then|he says|to the people,|'Be|worshippers|of me|besides Allah,|||but (would say)|'Be|pious scholars of the Lord|because|you have been|teaching|the Book|and because|you have been|studying (it).'
And not|he will order you|that|you take|the Angels,|and the Prophets|(as) lords.|Would he order you|to [the] disbelief|after|[when]|you (have) become|Muslims?
And when|Allah took||covenant|of the Prophets,|'Certainly, whatever|I (have) given you|of|(the) Book|and wisdom|then|comes to you|a Messenger|confirming|that which|(is) with you,|you must believe|in him|and you must help him.'|He said,|'Do you affirm|and take|on|that (condition)|My Covenant?'|They said,|'We affirm.'|He said,|'Then bear witness,|and I am|with you|among|the witnesses.'
Then whoever|turns away|after|that,|then those|they|(are) the transgressors.
So is (it) other than|the religion|(of) Allah|they seek?|While to Him|(have) submitted|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth,|willingly|or unwillingly,|and towards Him|they will be returned.
Say,|'We believed|in Allah|and what|(is) revealed|on us|and what|was revealed|on|Ibrahim,|and Ismail,|and Ishaq,|and Yaqub,|and the descendents|and what|was given|to Musa,|and Isa,|and the Prophets|from|their Lord.|Not|we make distinction|between|any|of them|and we|to Him|(are) submissive.
And whoever|seeks|other than|[the] Islam|(as) religion|then never will|be accepted|from him,|and he|in|the Hereafter,|(will be) from|the losers.
How|(shall) Allah guide||a people|(who) disbelieved|after|their belief|and had witnessed|that|the Messenger|(is) true,|and came to them|the clear proofs?|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people|[the] wrongdoers.
Those -|their recompense,|that|on them|(will be) curse|of Allah|and the Angels|and the people|all together.
(They will) abide forever|in it.|Not|will be lightened|for them|the punishment|and not|they|will be reprieved.
Except|those who|repent|after||that,|and reform[ed] themselves.|Then indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved|after|their belief|then|they increased|(in) disbelief|never will|be accepted|their repentance,|and those -|they|(are)  those who have gone astray.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve[d]|and died|while they|(are) disbelievers,|then never will|be accepted|from|any one of them|earth full||(of) gold|[and] (even) if|he offered it as ransom.||Those-|for them|(is) a punishment|painful|and not|(will be) for them|from|any helpers.
Never|will you attain|[the] righteousness|until|you spend|from what|you love.|And whatever|you spend|of|a thing|then indeed,|Allah|of it|(is) All-Knowing.
All|[the] food|was|lawful|for (the) Children of Israel||except|what|Israel made unlawful||upon|himself|[from]|before|[that]|(was) revealed|theTaurat.|Say,|"So bring|the Taurat|and recite it|if|you are|truthful."
Then whoever|fabricates|about|Allah|[the] lie|after||that,|then those  -|they|(are) the wrongdoers.
Say,|Allah (has) spoken the truth,||then follow|(the) religion|(of) Ibrahim|(the) upright,|and not|he was|of|the polytheists.
Indeed,|(the) first|House|set up|for the mankind|(is) the one which|(is) at Bakkah,|blessed|and a guidance|for the worlds.
In it|(are) signs|clear,|standing place of Ibrahim,||and whoever|enters it -|is|safe.|And (due) to Allah|upon|the mankind|(is) pilgrimage|(of) the House|(for one) who|is able|to [it]|(find) a way.|And whoever|disbelieved|then indeed,|Allah|(is) free from need|of|the universe.
Say,|"O People of the Book ||Why|(do) you disbelieve|in (the) Verses|(of) Allah,|while Allah|(is) a Witness|over|what|you do?"
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book |Why|(do) you hinder|from|(the) way|(of) Allah|(those) who|believe[d],|seeking (to make) it|(seem) crooked|while you|(are) witnesses?|And Allah (is) not||unaware|of what|you do.
O you|who|believe[d] |If|you obey|a group|from|those who|were given|the Book|they will turn you back|after|your belief|(as) disbelievers.
And how (could)|you disbelieve|while [you]|is recited|upon you|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|and among you|(is) His Messenger?|And whoever|holds firmly|to Allah,|then surely|he is guided|to|a straight path.|
O you|who|believe[d] |Fear|Allah|(as is His) right|(that) He (should) be feared|and (do) not|die|except|[while you]|(as) Muslims.
And hold firmly|to (the) rope|(of) Allah|all together|and (do) not|be divided.|And remember|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|on you|when|you were|enemies|then He made friendship|between|your hearts|then you became|by His Favor|brothers.|And you were|on|(the) brink|(of) pit|of|the Fire|then He saved you|from it.|Thus|Allah makes clear||for you|His Verses|so that you may|(be) guided.
And let there be|among you|[a] people|inviting|to|the good|[and] enjoining|the right,|and forbidding|from|the wrong,|and those -|they|(are) the successful ones.
And (do) not|be|like those who|became divided|and differed|after||what|came to them -|the clear proofs.|And those|for them|(is) a punishment|great.
(On the) Day|would become white|(some) faces|and would become black|(some) faces.|As for|those whose|[their] faces turn black -||"Did you disbelieve|after|your belief?|Then taste|the punishment|for what|you used to|disbelieve."
But as for|those whose|[their] faces turn white||then (they will be) in|(the) Mercy|(of) Allah,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
These|(are the) Verses|(of) Allah.|We recite them|to you|in truth.|And not|Allah|wants|injustice|to the worlds.
And to Allah (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And to|Allah|will be returned|the matters.
You are|(the) best|(of) people|raised|for the mankind -|enjoining|the right|and forbidding|[from]|the wrong|and believing|in Allah.|And if|believed|(the) People|(of) the Book|surely would have been|good|for them.|Among them|(are) [the] believers,|but most of them|(are) defiantly disobedient.
Never|will they harm you|except|a hurt.|And if|they fight you,|they will turn (towards) you|the backs,|then|not|they will be helped.
Struck|on them|the humiliation|wherever||they are found|except|with a rope|from|Allah|and a rope|from|the people.|And they incurred|wrath|from|Allah|and struck|on them|the poverty.|That|(is) because|they used to|disbelieve|in (the) Verses|(of) Allah|and they killed|the Prophets|without|right.|That|(is) because|they disobeyed|and they used to|transgress.
They are not|(the) same;|among|(the) People|(of) the Book|(is) a community|standing|(and) reciting|(the) Verses of Allah||(in the) hours|(of) the night|and they|prostrate.
They believe|in Allah|and the Day|the Last|and they enjoin|[with] the right|and forbid|[from]|the wrong|and they hasten|in|the good deeds.|And those|(are) from|the righteous.
And whatever|they do|of|a good,|then never|will they be denied it.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing|of the God-fearing.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved,|never|will avail|[for] them|their wealth|and not|their children|against|Allah|anything,|and those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
Example|(of) what|they spend|in|this|[the] life|(of) the world|(is) like (the) example|(of) a wind|in it|(is) frost,|it struck|(the) harvest|(of) a people|who wronged|themselves,|then destroyed it.|And not|(has) Allah wronged them||[and] but|themselves|they wronged.
O you|who|believe[d] |(Do) not|take|(as) intimates|from|other than yourselves,|not|they will spare you|(any) ruin.|They wish|what|distresses you.|Indeed,|(has become) apparent|the hatred|from|their mouths,|and what|conceals|their breasts|(is) greater.|Certainly|We made clear|for you|the Verses,|if|you were|(to use) reason.
Lo  You are|those,|you love them|but not|they love you|and you believe|in the Book -|all of it.|And when|they meet you|they say,|"We believe."|And when|they are alone|they bite|at you|the finger tips|(out) of|[the] rage.|Say,|"Die|in your rage.|Indeed.|Allah|(is) All-Knowing|of what|(is in) the breasts."
If|touches you|a good,|it grieves them|and if|strikes you|misfortune,|they rejoice|at it.|And if|you are patient|and fear (Allah),|not|will harm you|their plot|(in) anything.|Indeed,|Allah,|of what|they do|(is) All-Encompassing.
And when|you left early morning|from|your household|to post|the believers|(to take) positions|for the battle.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
When|inclined|two parties|among you|that|they lost heart,|but Allah|(was) their protector.|And on|Allah|let put (their) trust|the believers.
And certainly|helped you|Allah|in Badr|while you (were)|weak.|So fear|Allah|so that you may|(be) grateful.
When|you said|to the believers,|"Is it not|enough for you|that|reinforces you|your Lord|with three|thousand[s]|[of]|[the] Angels|[the ones] sent down?
Yes,|if|you are patient|and fear (Allah)|and they come upon you|[of]|suddenly,|[this]|will reinforce you|your Lord|with five|thousand[s]|[of]|[the] Angels|[the ones] having marks.
And not|made it|Allah|except|(as) good news|for you|and to reassure|your hearts|with it.|And (there is) no|[the] victory|except|from|[near]|Allah,|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
That He may cut off|a part|of|those who|disbelieved|or|suppress them|so (that) they turn back|disappointed.
Not|for you|of|the decision|(of) anything|whether|He turns|to them|or|punishes them|for indeed, they|(are) wrongdoers.
And to Allah (belongs)|what|(is) in|the heavens|and what|(is) in|the earth,|He forgives|[for] whom|He wills|and punishes|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
O you|who|believe |(Do) not|eat|the usury|doubled|multiplied.|And fear|Allah|so that you may|(be) successful.
And fear|the Fire|which|is prepared|for the disbelievers.
And obey|Allah|and the Messenger|so that you may|receive mercy.
And hasten|to|forgiveness|from|your Lord|and a Garden -|its width|(is like that of) the heavens|and the earth|prepared|for the pious.
Those who|spend|in|[the] ease|and (in) the hardship|and those who restrain|the anger|and those who pardon|[from]|the people -|and Allah|loves|the good-doers.
And those|when|they did|immorality|or|wronged|themselves -|they remember|Allah|then ask forgiveness|for their sins -|and who|(can) forgive|the sins|except|Allah?|And not|they persist|on|what|they did|while they|know.
Those -|their reward|(is) forgiveness|from|their Lord|and Gardens|flows|from|underneath it|the rivers,|abiding forever|in it.|And an excellent|reward|(for) the (righteous) workers.
Verily|passed|before you||situations,|then travel|in|the earth|and see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the deniers.
This|(is) a declaration|for the people|and guidance|and admonition|for the God-fearing.
And (do) not|weaken|and (do) not|grieve|and you (will be)|[the] superior,|if|you are|believers.
If|touched you|a wound,|so certainly|(has) touched|the people|wound|like it.|And this|[the] days|We alternate them|among|the people|[and] so that Allah makes evident||those who|believe[d]|and take|from you|martyrs.|And Allah|(does) not|love|the wrongdoers.
And so that Allah may purify||those who|believe|and destroy|the disbelievers.
Or|do you think|that|you will enter|Paradise|while Allah has not yet made evident|||those who|strove hard|among you|and made evident|the steadfast.
And certainly|you used to|wish|(for) death|before||[that]|you met it,|then indeed,|you have seen it|while you [were]|looking on.
And not|(is) Muhammad -|except|a Messenger,|certainly|passed away|before him||[the] (other) Messengers.|So if|he died|or|is slain|will you turn back|on|your heels?|And whoever|turns back|on|his heels|then never|will he harm|Allah|(in) anything.|And Allah will reward||the grateful ones.
And not|is|for a soul|that|he dies|except|by (the) permission of Allah,||(at a) decree|determined.|And whoever|desires|reward|(of) the world -|We will give him|thereof;|and whoever|desires|reward|(of) the Hereafter|We will give him|thereof.|And We will reward|the grateful ones.
And how many|from|a Prophet|fought;|with him|(were) many religious scholars.||But not|they lost heart|for what|befell them|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and not|they weakened|and not|they gave in.|And Allah|loves|the patient ones.
And not|were|their words|except|that|they said,|"Our Lord|forgive|for us|our sins|and our excesses|in|our affairs|and make firm|our feet|and give us victory|against|[the people]|the disbelievers."
So Allah gave them||reward|(in) the world|and good|reward|(in) the Hereafter.|And Allah|loves|the good-doers.
O you|who|believe |If|you obey|those who|disbelieve,|they will turn you back|on|your heels,|then you will turn back|(as) losers.
Nay,|Allah|(is) your Protector|and He|(is the) best|(of) the Helpers.
We will cast|in|(the) hearts|(of) those who|disbelieve|[the] terror|because|they associated partners|with Allah,|what|not|He sent down|about it|any authority,|and their refuge|(will be) the Fire|and wretched|(is the) abode|[of] the wrongdoers.
And certainly|Allah fulfilled to you||His promise,|when|you were killing them|by His permission,|until|when|you lost courage|and you fell into dispute|concerning|the order|and you disobeyed||after|[what]|He (had) shown you|what|you love.|Among you|(are some) who|desire|the world|and among you|(are some) who|desire|the Hereafter.|Then|He diverted you|from them|so that He may test you.|And surely|He forgave|you.|And Allah|(is the) Possessor|(of) Bounty|for|the believers.
When|you were running uphill|and not|casting a glance on||anyone|while the Messenger|was calling you|[in]|(from) behind you.|So (He) repaid you|(with) distress|on distress|so that not|you grieve|over|what|escaped you|and not|what|(had) befallen you.|And Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do.
Then|He sent down|upon you||after|the distress|security -|slumber|overcoming|a group|of you,|while a group|certainly|worried [them]|(about) themselves|thinking|about Allah|other than|the truth -|(the) thought|(of) [the] ignorance.|saying,|"Is (there)|for us|from|the matter|any|thing?"|Say,|"Indeed|the matter|all (of) it|(is) for Allah."|They hide|in|themselves|what|not|they reveal|to you,|They say,|"If|was|for us|from|the matter|anything|not|we would have been killed|here."|Say,|"If|you were|in|your houses,|surely (would have) come out|those who -|was decreed|upon them|[the] death|towards|their places of death.|And that Allah might test||what|(is) in|your breasts|and that He may purge|what|(is) in|your hearts.|And Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what (is in) the breasts.|
Indeed,|those who|turned back|among you|(on the) day|met|the two hosts -|only|made them slip|the Shaitaan|for some|(of) what|they (had) earned.|And surely|Allah forgave||[on] them,|indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|All-Forbearing.
O you|who|believe[d] |(Do) not|be|like those who|disbelieved|and they said|about their brothers|when|they traveled|in|the earth|or|they were|fighting,|"If|they had been|with us,|they (would) not (have) died||and not|they would have been killed."|So Allah makes||that|a regret|in|their hearts.|And Allah|gives life|and causes death,|and Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
And if|you are killed|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|or|die[d] -|certainly forgiveness|from|Allah|and Mercy|(are) better|than what|they accumulate.
And if|you die|or|are killed,|surely to|Allah|you will be gathered.
So because|(of) Mercy|from|Allah|you dealt gently|with them.|And if|you had been|rude|(and) harsh|(at) [the] heart,|surely they (would have) dispersed|from|around you.|Then pardon|[from] them|and ask forgiveness|for them|and consult them|in|the matter.|Then when|you have decided,|then  put trust|on|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|the ones who put trust (in Him).
If|Allah helps you,||then not|(can) overcome|[for] you,|and if|He forsakes you,|then who|(is) the one||(who can) help you||after Him?|And on|Allah -|let the believers put (their) trust.|
And not|is|for a Prophet|that|he defrauds.|And whoever|defrauds|will bring|what|he had defrauded|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection.|Then|is repaid in full|every|soul|what|it earned|and they|(will) not|be wronged.
So is (the one) who|pursues|(the) pleasure|(of) Allah|like (the one) who|draws|on (himself) wrath|of|Allah|and his abode|(is) hell,|and wretched|(is) the destination?
They|(are in varying) degrees|near|Allah,|and Allah|(is) All-Seer|of what|they do.
Certainly|Allah bestowed a Favor||upon|the believers|as|He raised|among them|a Messenger|from|themselves|reciting|to them|His Verses|and purifying them,|and teaching them|the Book|and the wisdom,|although|they were|before (that)||in certainly|(the) error|clear.
Or|when|struck you|disaster,|surely|you (had) struck (them)|twice of it,|you said,|"From where|(is) this?"|Say,|"It|(is) from|yourselves."|Indeed,|Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And what|struck you|(on the) day|(when) met|the two hosts|by (the) permission|(of) Allah|and that He (might) make evident|the believers.
And that He (might) make evident|those who|(are) hypocrites.|And it was said|to them,|"Come,|fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|or|defend."|They said,|"If|we knew|fighting|certainly we (would have) followed you."|They -|to disbelief|that day|(were) nearer|than [them]|to the faith,|saying|with their mouths|what|was not|in|their hearts.|And Allah|(is) Most Knowing|(of) what|they conceal.
Those who|said|about their brothers|while they sat,|"If|they (had) obeyed us|not|they would have been killed."|Say,|"Then avert|from|yourselves|[the] death|if|you are|truthful.
And (do) not|think|(of) those who|are killed|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|(as) dead.|Nay |They are alive,|near|their Lord;|they are given provision.
Rejoicing|in what|Allah bestowed them||of|His Bounty,|and they receive good tidings|about those who|(have) not|yet joined|[with] them|[from]|(but are) left behind -|that (there will be) no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
They receive good tidings|of Favor|from|Allah|and Bounty|and that|Allah|(does) not|let go waste|(the) reward|(of) the believers.
Those who|responded|to Allah|and the Messenger|after||what|befell them -|the injury -|for those who|did good|among them|and feared Allah,|(is) a reward -|great.
Those who|said|to them|[the people],|"Indeed|the people|(have) certainly|gathered|against you,|so fear them."|But it increased them|(in the) faith|and they said,|"Sufficient for us|(is) Allah|and (He is the) best|[the] Disposer of affairs."
So they returned|with (the) Favor|of|Allah|and Bounty,|not|touched them|any harm.|And they followed|(the) pleasure|(of) Allah,|and Allah|(is) Possessor|(of) Bounty|great.
(It is) only|that|the Shaitaan|frightens (you)|(of) his allies.|So (do) not|fear them,|but fear Me,|if|you are|believers.
And (let) not|grieve you|those who|hasten|in(to)|[the] disbelief.|Indeed, they|never|will harm|Allah|(in) anything.|Allah intends||that not|He will set|for them|any portion|in|the Hereafter.|And for them|(is) a punishment|great.
Indeed,|those who|(have) purchased|[the] disbelief|with the faith|never|will they harm|Allah|(in) anything,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
And (let) not|think|those who|disbelieved|that|We give respite|to them|(is) good|for themselves.|Only|We give respite|to them|so that they may increase|(in) sins,|and for them|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
Allah is not|||to leave|the believers|on|what|you (are)|in [it]|until|He separates|the evil|from|the good.|And Allah is not|||to inform you|about|the unseen,|[and] but|Allah|chooses|from|His Messengers|whom|He wills,|so believe|in Allah|and His Messengers,|and if|you believe|and fear (Allah)|then for you|(is a) reward|great.
And (let) not|think|those who|withhold|of what|Allah (has) given them||of|His Bounty|(that) it|(is) good|for them.|Nay,|it|(is) bad|for them.|Their necks will be encircled|(with) what|they withheld|[with it]|(on the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection.|And for Allah|(is the) heritage|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|And Allah,|with what|you do,|(is) All-Aware.
Certainly,|Allah heard||(the) saying|(of) those who|said,|"Indeed|Allah|(is) poor|while we|(are) rich."|We will record|what|they said|and their killing|the Prophets|without|(any) right,|and We will say,|"Taste|(the) punishment|(of) the Burning Fire."
That|(is) because|(of what) sent forth|your hands|and that|Allah|is not|unjust|to (His) slaves.
Those who|said,|"Indeed|Allah|(has) taken promise|from us|that not|we (should) believe|in a Messenger|until|he brings to us|a sacrifice -|consumes it|the fire."|Say,|"Surely|came to you|Messengers||before me|with the clear Signs|and with what|you speak.|So why|you killed them,|if|you are|truthful.
Then if|they reject you,|then certainly|were rejected|Messengers||before you|(who) came|with the clear Signs|and the Scriptures|and the Book -|[the] Enlightening.
Every|soul|(will) taste|[the] death,|and only|you will be paid in full|your reward|(on the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection.|Then whoever|is drawn away|from|the Fire|and admitted|(to) Paradise|then surely|he is successful.|And not|(is) the life|(of) the world|except|enjoyment|(of) delusion.
You will certainly be tested|in|your wealth|and yourselves.|And you will certainly hear|from|those who|were given|the Book|before you||and from|those who|associate partners with Allah -|hurtful things|many,|and if|you are patient|and fear (Allah)|then indeed,|that|(is) of|the matters of determination.|
And when|Allah took||a Covenant|(from) those who|were given|the Book,|"You certainly make it clear|to the mankind|and (do) not|conceal it.|Then they threw it|behind|their backs|and they exchanged|[with] it|(for) a little price.||And wretched|(is) what|they purchase.
(Do) not|think|(that) those who|rejoice|in what|(they have) brought|and they love|that|they be praised|for what|not|they do -|so (do) not|think (that) they|(will) escape|from|the punishment;|and for them|(is a) punishment|painful.
And for Allah|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
Indeed,|in|(the) creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and (in the) alternation|(of) the night|and the day|(are) surely Signs|for men|(of) understanding.
Those who|remember|Allah|standing,|and sitting|and on|their sides|and they reflect|on|(the) creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|"Our Lord,|not|You have created|this|(in) vain.|Glory be to You,|so save us|(from the) punishment|(of) the Fire.
Our Lord,|indeed [You]|whom|You admit|(to) the Fire|then surely|You (have) disgraced him,|and not|for the wrongdoers|(are) any|helpers.
Our Lord,|indeed we|[we] heard|a caller|calling|to the faith|that|'Believe|in your Lord,'|so we have believed.|Our Lord|so forgive|for us|our sins|and remove|from us|our evil deeds,|and cause us to die|with|the righteous.
Our Lord,|grant us|what|You promised us|through|Your Messengers|and (do) not|disgrace us|(on the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection.|Indeed, You|(do) not|break|the promise."
Then responded|to them|their Lord,|"Indeed, I|(will) not|(let go) waste|deeds|(of the) doer|among you|[from]|(whether) male|or|female|each of you|from|(the) other.|So those who|emigrated|and were driven out|from|their homes,|and were harmed|in|My way|and fought|and were killed -|surely I (will) remove|from them|their evil deeds|and surely I will admit them|(to) Gardens|flowing|from|underneath them|the rivers -|a reward|from|[near]|Allah.|And Allah -|with Him|(is the) best|reward."
(Let) not|deceive you|(the) movement|(of) those who|disbelieved|in|the land.
An enjoyment|little,|then|their abode|(is) hell -|[and] a wretched|[the] resting place.
But|those who|fear|their Lord,|for them|(will be) Gardens|flows|from|underneath them|the rivers,|will abide forever|in it -|a hospitality|from|[near]|Allah.|And that|(which is) with|Allah|(is) best|for the righteous.
And indeed,|among|(the) People|(of) the Book|(are those) who|believe|in Allah|and what|was revealed|to you|and what|was revealed|to them  -|humbly submissive|to Allah.|They (do) not exchange||[with] (the) Verses|(of) Allah|(for) a price|little.|Those,|for them,|their reward|(is) with|their Lord.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) swift|(in taking) the account.
O you|who|believe[d] |Be steadfast|and [be] patient|and [be] constant|and fear|Allah|so that you may|(be) successful.
O|mankind |Fear|your Lord|the One Who|created you|from|a soul|single|and created|from it|its mate|and dispersed|from both of them|many men||and women.|And fear|Allah|(through) Whom|you ask|[with it]|and the wombs.|Indeed,|Allah|is|over you|Ever-Watchful.
And give|(to) the orphans|their wealth,|and (do) not|exchange|the bad|with the good,|and (do) not|consume|their wealth|with|your wealth.|Indeed, it|is|a sin|great.
And if|you fear|that not|you will be able to do justice|with|the orphans,|then marry|what|seems suitable|to you|from|the women|two,|or three,|or four.|But if|you fear|that not|you can do justice|then (marry) one|or|what|possesses|your right hand.|That|(is) more appropriate|that you (may) not oppress.|
And give|the women|their dower|graciously.|But if|they remit|to you|anything||of it|(on their) own,|then eat it|(in) satisfaction|(and) ease.
And (do) not|give|the foolish|your wealth|which|Allah made||for you|a means of support|(but) provide (for) them|with it|and clothe them|and speak|to them|words|(of) kindness.
And test|the orphans|until|[when]|they reach[ed]|(the age of) marriage,|then if|you perceive|in them|sound judgement|then deliver|to them|their wealth.|And (do) not|eat it|extravagantly|and hastily|(fearing) that|they will grow up.|And whoever|is|rich|then he should refrain,|and whoever|is|poor|then let him eat (of it)|in a fair manner.|Then when|you deliver|to them|their wealth|then take witnesses|on them.|And Allah is sufficient||(as) a Reckoner.
For the men|a portion|of what|(is) left|(by) the parents,|and the near relatives|and for the women|a portion|of what|(is) left|(by) parents|and the near relatives|of what|(is) little|of it|or|much -|a portion|obligatory.
And when|present|(at) the (time of) division|the relatives||and the orphans|and the poor,|then provide  them|from it|and speak|to them|words|(of) kindness.
And let fear -|those who,|if|they left|behind||offspring|weak|(and) they would have feared|about them.|So let them fear|Allah|and let them speak|words|appropriate.
Indeed,|those who|consume|wealth|(of) the orphans|wrongfully,|only|they consume|in|their bellies|fire,|and they will be burned|(in) a Blazing Fire.
Allah instructs you||concerning|your children -|for the male|like|(the) portion|(of) two females.|But if|there are|(only) women|more (than)|two,|then for them|two thirds|(of) what|he left.|And if|(there) is|(only) one,|then for her|(is) half.|And for his parents,|for each|one|of them|a sixth|of what|(is) left,|if|for him is||a child.|But if|not|for him is||any child|and inherit[ed] him|his parents,|then for his mother|(is) one third.|And if|for him are||brothers and sisters,|then for his mother|(is) the sixth|after||any will|he has made|[of which]|or|any debt.|Your parents|and your children -|not|you know|which of them|(is) nearer|to you|(in) benefit.|An obligation|from|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And for you|(is) half|(of) what|(is) left|by your wives|if|not|for them is||a child.|But if|for them is||a child,|then for you|(is) the fourth|of what|they left,|after||any will|they have made|[for which]|or|any debt.|And for them|(is) the fourth|of what|you left,|if|not|for you is||a child.|But if|for you is||a child,|then for them|(is) the eighth|of what|you left||after|any will|you have made|[for which]|or|any debt.|And if|[is]|a man|(whose wealth) is to be inherited|(has) no parent or child|or|a women|and for him|(is) a brother|or|a sister,|then for each|one|of (the) two|(is) the sixth.|But if|they are|more|than|that,|then they|(are) partners|in|the third,|after||any will|was made|[for which]|or|any debt|without|(being) harmful.|An ordinance|from|Allah.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing,|All- Forbearing.
These|(are the) limits|(of) Allah,|and whoever|obeys|Allah|and His Messenger,|He will admit him|(to) Gardens|flows|from|underneath them|the rivers -|(will) abide forever|in it.|And that|(is) the success|[the] great.
And whoever|disobeys|Allah|and His Messenger|and transgresses|His limits -|He will admit him|(to) Fire|(will) abide forever|in it.|And for him|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
And those who|commit|[the] immorality|from|your women|then call to witness|against them|four|among you.|And if|they testify|then confine them|in|their houses|until|comes to them|[the] death|or|Allah makes||for them|a way.
And the two who|commit it|among you,|then punish both of them.|But if|they repent|and correct themselves,|then turn away|from both of them.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-forgiving,|Most-Merciful.
Only|the acceptance of repentance|by|Allah|(is) for those who|do|the evil|in ignorance,|then|they repent|soon after.||Then those|will have forgiveness|(from) Allah|upon them,|and Allah is||All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And not|(is) the acceptance of repentance|for those who|do|the evil deeds|until|when|approaches|one of them|[the] death,|he says,|"Indeed I|repent|now;"|and not|those who|die|while they|(are) disbelievers.|Those -|We have prepared|for them|a punishment|painful.
O you|who|believe[d] |Not|(is) lawful|for you|that|you inherit|the women|(by) force.|And not|you constraint them|so that you may take|a part|(of) what|you have given them|except|that|they commit|immorality|open.|And live with them|in kindness.|But if|you dislike them,|then perhaps|that|you dislike|a thing|and Allah placed||in it|much good.|
And if|you intend|replacing|a wife|(in) place|(of) a wife|and you have given|one of them|heap (of gold)|then (do) not|take away|from it|anything.|Would you take it|(by) slander|and a sin|open?
And how|could you take it|when surely|has gone -|one of you|to|another,|and they have taken|from you|covenant|strong?
And (do) not|marry|whom|married|your fathers|of|the women|except|what|has passed before,||indeed it|was|an immorality|and hateful,|and (an) evil|way.
Forbidden|to you|(are) your mothers|and your daughters|and your sisters|and your father's sisters|and your mother's sisters|and daughters|(of) brothers,|and daughters|(of) sisters|and (the) mothers|who|nursed you|and your sisters|from|the nursing|and mothers|(of) your wives|and your step daughters|who|(are) in|your guardianship|of|your women|whom|you had relations|with them,|but if|not|you had|relations|with them,|then (there is) no|sin|on you.|And wives|of your sons,|those who|(are) from|your loins|and that|you gather together|[between]|two sisters|except|what|has passed before.||Indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Forgiving,|Most-Merciful.
And (prohibited are) the ones who are married|of|the women|except|whom|you rightfully possess.||Decree of Allah||upon you.|And are lawful|to you|what|(is) beyond|that;|that|you seek|with your wealth|desiring to be chaste|not|(to be) lustful.|So what|you benefit[ed]|of it|from them,|so you give them|their bridal due|(as) an obligation.|And (there is) no|sin|on you|concerning what|you mutually agree|of it|beyond||the obligation.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And whoever|(is) not|among you - able to||afford|to marry||the free chaste|[the] believing women|then (marry) from|what|possess[ed]|your right hands|of|your girls -|(of) the believers.|And Allah|knows best|about your faith.|You|(are) from|(one) another.|So marry them|with (the) permission|(of) their family|and give them|their bridal due|in a fair manner.|(They should be) chaste|not|those who commit immorality|and not|those who take|secret lovers.|Then when|they are married|and if|they commit|adultery|then for them|(is) half|(of) what|(is) on|the free chaste women|of|the punishment.|That|(is) for whoever|fears|committing sin|among you|and that|you be patient|(is) better|for you.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Allah wishes||to make clear|to you|and to guide you|(to) ways|(of) those|before you||and (to) accept repentance|from you.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And Allah|wishes|to|accept repentance|from you,|but wish|those who|follow|the passions|that|you deviate -|(into) a deviation|great.
Allah wishes||to|lighten|for you;|and was created|the mankind|weak.
O you|who|believe[d] |(Do) not|eat|your wealth|between yourselves|unjustly.|But|that|(there) be|business|on|mutual consent|among you.|And (do) not|kill|yourselves.|Indeed,|Allah|is|to you|Most Merciful.
And whoever|does|that|(in) aggression|and injustice,|then soon|We (will) cast him|(into) a Fire.|And that is||for|Allah|easy.
If|you avoid|great (sins)|(of) what|you are forbidden|from [it],|We will remove|from you|your evil deeds|and  We will admit you|(to) an entrance|a noble.
And (do) not|covet|what|Allah (has) bestowed||[with it]|some of you|over|others.|For men|(is) a share|of what|they earned,|and for women|(is) a share|of what|they earned.|And ask|Allah|of|His Bounty.|Indeed,|Allah|is|of every|thing|All-Knower.
And for all|We (have) made|heirs|of what|(is) left|(by) the parents|and the relatives.|And those whom|pledged|your right hands -|then give them|their share.|Indeed,|Allah|is|over|every|thing|a Witness.
[The] men|(are) protectors|of|the women|because|Allah (has) bestowed||some of them|over|others|and because|they spend|from|their wealth.|So the righteous women|(are) obedient,|guarding|in the unseen|that which|Allah (orders) them to guard.||And those (from) whom|you fear|their ill-conduct|then advise them,|and forsake them|in|the bed|and set forth to them/ strike them.|Then if|they obey you|then (do) not|seek|against them|a way.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Most High,|Most Great.
And if|you fear|a dissension|between (the) two of them,|then send|an arbitrator|from|his family|and an arbitrator|from|her family.|If|they both wish|reconciliation,|Allah will cause reconciliation||between both of them.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Knower,|All-Aware.
And worship|Allah|And (do) not|associate|with Him|anything,|and to the parents|(do) good,|and with the relatives,||and the orphans,|and the needy|and the neighbor|(who is) near,||and the neighbor|(who is) farther away,|and the companion|by your side|and the traveler||and what|possess[ed]|your right hands.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|(the one) who|is|[a] proud|(and) [a] boastful.
Those who|are stingy|and order|the people|[of] stinginess|and hide|what|Allah (has) given them||of|His Bounty -|and  We (have) prepared|for the disbelievers|a punishment|humiliating.
And those who|spend|their wealth|to be seen|(by) the people|and not|they believe|in Allah|and not|in the Day|the Last,|and whoever|has|the Shaitaan|for him|(as) companion -|then evil|(is he as) a companion.
And what|(is) against them|if|they believed|in Allah|and the Day|the Last|and spent|from what|Allah (has) provided them?||And Allah is||about them|All-Knower.
Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|wrong|(as much as) weight|(of) an atom.|And if|there is|a good|He doubles it|and gives|from|near Him|a reward|great.
So how (will it be)|when|We bring|from|every|nation|a witness|and We bring|you|against|these (people)|(as) a witness.
(On) that Day|will wish|those who|disbelieved|and disobeyed|the Messenger|if|was leveled|with them|the earth|and not|they will (be able to) hide|(from) Allah|(any) statement.
O you|who|believe[d] |(Do) not|go near|the prayer|while you|(are) intoxicated|until|you know|what|you are saying|and not|(when you are) impure|except|(when) passing|(through) a way|until|you have bathed.|And if|you are|ill|or|on|a journey|or|came|one|of you|from|the toilet,|or|you have touched|the women|and not|you find|water,|then do tayammum|(with) earth|clean|and wipe (with it)|your faces|and your hands.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Pardoning,|Oft-Forgiving.
Did not|you see,|[towards]|those who|were given|a portion|of|the Book,|purchasing|[the] error|and wishing|that|you stray|(from) the way?
And Allah|knows better|about your enemies|and Allah (is) sufficient||(as) a Protector,|and sufficient|(is) Allah|(as) a Helper.
Of|those who|are Jews,|they distort|the words|from|their places|and they say,|"We hear[d]|and we disobey[ed]"|and "Hear|not|to be heard|and "Raina"|twisting|[with] their tongues|and defaming|[in]|the religion.|And if|[that] they|(had) said,|"We hear[d]|and we obey[ed]"|and "Hear|and look (at) us,"|surely it (would) have been|better|for them|and more suitable.|[And] but|Allah cursed them||for their disbelief,|so not|they believe|except|a few.
O you|who|(have) been given|the Book,|believe|in what|We (have) revealed|confirming|what is|with you,||before|[that]|We efface|faces|and turn them|on|their backs|or|We curse them|as|We cursed|companions|(of) the Sabbath.|And|command of  Allah||is (always) executed.
Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|forgive|that|partners be associated|with Him,|but He forgives|other than||that|for whom|He wills.|And whoever|associates partners|with Allah,|then surely|he has fabricated|a sin -|tremendous.
Do not|you see|[towards]|those who|claim purity|(for) themselves?|Nay,|(it is) Allah,|He purifies|whom|He wills|and not|they will be wronged|(even as much as) a hair on a date-seed.
See|how|they invent|about|Allah|[the] lie,|and sufficient|is it -|(as) a sin|manifest.
Do not|you see|[towards]|those who|were given|a portion|of|the Book?|They believe|in the superstition|and the false deities,|and they say|for those who|disbelieve[d]|"These|(are) better guided|than|those who|believe[d]|(as to the) way.
Those|(are) the ones|(whom) Allah (has) cursed,||and whoever|Allah curses||then never|will you find|for him|(any) helper.
Or|for them|(is) a share|of|the Kingdom?|Then|they would not give||the people|(even as much as the) speck on a date seed.
Or|are they jealous|(of) the people|for|what|Allah gave them||from|His Bounty?|But surely|We gave|(the) family|(of) Ibrahim|the Book|and [the] wisdom|and [We] gave them|a kingdom|great.
Then of them|(are some) who|believed|in him|and of them|(are some) who|turned away|from him,|and sufficient|(is) Hell|(as a) Blazing Fire.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved|in Our Signs,|soon|We will burn them|(in) a Fire.|Every time|are roasted|their skins|We will change their|skins|for other (than) that,|so that they may taste|the punishment.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
And those who|believe[d]|and did|the good deeds|We will admit them|(in) Gardens|flows|from|underneath it|the rivers,|will abide|in it|forever.|For them|in it|(are) spouses|pure,|and We will admit them|(in the) shade|thick.
Indeed,|Allah orders you||to|render|the trusts|to|their owners,|and when|you judge|between|the people|to|judge|with justice.|Indeed,|Allah|excellently|advises you|with it.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Hearing,|All-Seeing.
O you|who|believe[d] |Obey|Allah|and obey|the Messenger|and those having authority||among you.|Then if|you disagree|in|anything,|refer it|to|Allah|and the Messenger,|if|you|believe|in Allah|and the Day|[the] Last.|That|(is) best|and more suitable|(for final) determination.
Do you not see||[towards]|those who|claim|that they|believe|in what|(is) revealed|to you|and what|was revealed|before you?||They wish|to|go for judgment|to|the false deities|and surely|they were ordered|to|reject|[with] it.|And the Shaitaan wishes||to|mislead them|astray -|far away.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Come|to|what|Allah (has) revealed||and to|the Messenger,"|you see|the hypocrites|turning away|from you|(in) aversion.
So how|when|befalls them|disaster|for what|sent forth|their hands|then|they come to you|swearing|by Allah,|"Not|we intended|except|good|and reconciliation."
Those|(are) the ones who -|Allah knows||what|(is) in|their hearts,|so turn away|from them|and admonish them,|and say|to them|concerning|their souls|a word|penetrating.
And not We sent||any Messenger||except|to be obeyed|by (the) permission of Allah.||And if|[that] they,|when|they wronged|themselves,|(had) come to you|and asked forgiveness|(of) Allah,|and asked forgiveness|for them|the Messenger,|surely they would have found|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most-Merciful.
But no,|by your Lord,|they will not believe||until|they make you judge|about what|arises|between them,|then|not|they find|in|themselves|any discomfort|about what|you (have) decided|and submit|(in full) submission.
And if|[that] We|(had) decreed|on them|that,|"Kill|yourselves"|or|"Go forth|from|your homes,"|not|they would have done it|except|a few|of them.|But if|[that] they|had done|what|they were advised|with [it],|surely (it) would have been|better|for them|and stronger|strengthen(ing).
And then|We would (have) given them|from|Ourselves|a great reward.|
And We would have guided them|(to the) straight way.|
And whoever|obeys|Allah|and the Messenger|then those|(will be) with|those whom|Allah has bestowed (His) Favor||upon them -|of|the Prophets,|and the truthful,|and the martyrs,|and the righteous.|And excellent|(are) those|companion(s).
That|(is) the Bounty|of|Allah,|and Allah is sufficient,||(as) All-Knower.
O you|who|believe[d] |Take|your precautions|and advance|(in) groups|or|advance|all together.
And indeed,|among you|(is he) who|lags behind|then if|befalls you|a disaster|he said,|"Verily|Allah (has) favored||[on] me|[when]|(that) not|I was|present with them."|
And if|befalls you|bounty|from|Allah|he would surely say|as if|(had) not|there been|between you|and between him|any affection,|"Oh  I wish|I had been|with them|then I would have attained|a success|great."
So let fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|those who|sell|the life|(of) the world|for the Hereafter.|And whoever|fights|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|then he is killed|or|achieves victory|then soon|We will grant him|a reward|a great.
And what|for you|(that) not|you fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|and (for) those who are weak|among|the men|and the women|and the children,|those who|say,|"Our Lord|take us out|of|this|[the] town|[the] oppressor(s)|(are) its people|and appoint|for us|from|Yourself|a protector|and appoint|for us|from|Yourself|a helper.
Those who|believe,|they fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah;|and those|who disbelieve,|they fight|in|(the) way|(of) the false deities.|So fight (against)|(the) friends|(of) the Shaitaan.|Indeed,|(the) strategy|(of) the Shaitaan|is|weak.
Have you not seen||[towards]|those who|(when) it was said|to them,|"Restrain|your hands|and establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah?"|Then when|was ordained|on them|the fighting,|then|a group|of them|[they] fear|the people|as (they) fear|Allah|or|more intense|fear,|and they said,|"Our Lord|why|have You ordained|upon us|[the] fighting?|Why not|You postpone (it for) us|to|a near term."||Say,|"Enjoyment|(of) the world|(is) little|and the Hereafter|(is) better|for whoever|fears (Allah)|and not|you will be wronged|(even as much as) a hair on a date-seed.
"Wherever|you be|will overtake you|[the] death|even if|you are|in|towers|lofty.|And if|befalls them|any good|they say,|"This|(is) from||Allah."|And if|befalls them|any evil|they say,|"This|(is) from|you."|Say,|"All|(is) from Allah."|||So what (is wrong)|(with) these|[the] people,|they do not seem||(to) understand|any statement.
What(ever)|befalls you|of|(the) good|(is) from|Allah,|and whatever|befalls you|of|(the) evil|is) from)|yourself.|And We have sent you|for the people|(as) a Messenger,|and Allah is sufficient||(as) a Witness.
(He) who|obeys|the Messenger|then surely|he obeyed|Allah,|and whoever|turns away -|then not|We (have) sent you|over them|(as) a guardian.
And they say,|"(We pledge) obedience."|Then when|they leave|[from] you,||plan by night|a group|of them|other than|that which|you say.|But Allah|records|what|they plan by night.|So turn (away)|from them|and put (your) trust|in|Allah.|And sufficient is Allah||(as) a Trustee.
Then (do) not|they ponder|(on) the Quran?|And if|it had (been)|from||other than|Allah,|surely they (would have) found|in it|much contradiction.|
And when|comes to them|a matter|of|the security|or|[the] fear|they spread|[with] it.|But if|they (had) referred it|to|the Messenger|and to|those having authority||among them,|surely would have known it|those who|draw correct conclusion (from) it|among them.|And if not|(had been the) bounty|(of) Allah|on you|and His Mercy,|surely you (would have) followed|the Shaitaan|except|a few.
So fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah;|you are not responsible|except|(for) yourself.||And encourage|the believers,|perhaps|that Allah||will restrain|(the) might|(of) those who|disbelieved.|And Allah|(is) Stronger|(in) Might|and Stronger|(in) punishment.
Whoever|intercedes -|an intercession|good,|will have|for him|a share|of it;|and whoever|intercedes -|an intercession|evil,|will have|for him|a portion|of it.|And Allah||(is) on|every|thing|a Keeper.
And when|you are greeted|with a greeting,|then greet|with better|than it|or|return it.|Indeed,|Allah|is|of|every|thing|an Accountant.
Allah -|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|surely He will gather you|to|(the) Day|(of) Resurrection -|no|doubt|about it.|And who|(is) more truthful|than|Allah|(in) statement.
So what|(is the matter) with you|concerning|the hypocrites (that)|(you have become) two parties?|While Allah|cast them back|for what|they earned.|Do you wish|that|you guide|whom|Allah has let go astray?||And whoever|Allah lets go astray,||then never|will you find|for him|a way.
They wish|if|you disbelieve|as|they disbelieved|and you would be|alike.|So (do) not|take|from them|allies|until|they emigrate|in|(the) way|(of) Allah.|But if|they turn back,|seize them|and kill them|wherever|you find them.|And (do) not|take|from them|any ally|and not|any helper,
Except|those who|join|[to]|a group|between you|and between them|(is) a treaty|or|those who come to you|restraining|their hearts|that|they fight you|or|they fight|their people.|And if|Allah (had) willed,||surely He (would have) given them power|over you,|and surely they (would have) fought you.|So if|they withdraw from you|and (do) not|fight against you|and offer|to you|[the] peace|then not|Allah (has) made||for you|against them|a way.
You will find|others|wishing|that|they be secure from you|and they be secure from|their people,|Every time||they are returned|to|the temptation,|they are plunged|into it.|So if|not|they withdraw from you|and offer|to you|[the] peace|and they restrain|their hands,|then seize them|and kill them|wherever|you find them.|And those -|We made|for you|against them|an authority|clear.
And not|is|for a believer|that|he kills|a believer|except|(by) mistake.|And whoever|killed|a believer|(by) mistake,|then freeing|(of) a believing slave||and blood money|(is to be) paid|to|his family|unless|that|they remit (as) charity.|But if|(he) was|from|a people|hostile|to you|and he was|a believer|then freeing|(of) a believing slave.||And if|(he) was|from|a people|between you|and between them,|(is) a treaty,|then blood money|(is to be) paid|to|his family,|and freeing|(of) a believing slave.||And whoever|(does) not|find,|then fasting|(for) two months|consecutively,|(seeking) repentance|from|Allah,|and Allah is||All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And whoever|kills|a believer|intentionally|then his recompense|(is) Hell,|abiding in it forever||and Allah's wrath will fall||on him|and He (will) curse him|and He has prepared|for him|a punishment|great.
O you|who|believe[d] |When|you go forth|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|then investigate,|and (do) not|say|to (the one) who|offers|to you|(a greeting of) peace,|"You are not a believer,"||seeking|transitory gains|(of) the life|(of) the world,|for with|Allah|(are) booties|abundant.|Like that|you were||before,|then Allah conferred favor||upon you;|so investigate.|Indeed,|Allah|is|of what|you do|All-Aware.
Not|(are) equal|the ones who sit|among|the believers,|other than|the ones (who are)|[the] disabled,|and the ones who strive|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|with their wealth|and their lives.|Allah (has) preferred||the ones who strive|with their wealth|and their lives|to|the ones who sit|(in) rank.|And (to) all|Allah (has) promised||the best.|Allah (has) preferred||the ones who strive|over|the ones who sit|(with) a reward|great,
Ranks|from Him|and forgiveness,|and mercy.|And is|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|those whom -|take them (in death)|the Angels|(while) they (were) wronging|themselves|they say,|"In what (condition)|were you?"|They said,|"We were|oppressed|in|the earth."|They said,|"Not|was|(the) earth|(of) Allah|spacious (enough)|so that you (could) emigrate|in it?"|Then those|(will have) their abode|(in) Hell -|and it is an evil|destination.
Except|the  oppressed|among|the men|and the women|and the children|who are not able to||plan|and not|they are directed|(to) a way.
Then those,|may be,|[that]  Allah||will pardon|[on] them,|and is|Allah|Oft-Pardoning,|Oft-Forgiving.
And whoever|emigrates|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|will find|in|the earth|place(s) of refuge -|many,|and abundance.|And whoever|leaves|from|his home|(as) an emigrant|to|Allah|and His Messenger,|then|overtakes him|[the] death,|then certainly|(became) incumbent|his reward|on|Allah.|And Allah is||Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And when|you travel|in|the earth|then not|upon you|(is) any blame|that|you shorten|[of]|the prayer|if|you fear|that|(may) harm you|those who|disbelieved.|Indeed,|the disbelievers|are|for you|an enemy|open.
And when|you are|among them|and you lead|for them|the prayer,|then let stand|a group|of them|with you|and let them take|their arms.|Then when|they have prostrated,|then let them be|behind you||and let come (forward)|a group -|other,|(which has) not|prayed,|and let them pray|with you|and let them take|their precautions|and their arms.|Wished|those who|disbelieved|if|you neglect|[about]|your arms|and your baggage,|so (that) they (can) assault|[upon] you|(in) a single attack.||But (there is) no|blame|upon you|if|was|with you|any trouble|(because) of|rain|or|you are|sick|that|you lay down|your arms,|but take|your precautions.|Indeed,|Allah|has prepared|for the disbelievers|a punishment|humiliating.
Then when|you (have) finished|the prayer,|then remember|Allah|standing|and sitting|and (lying) on|your sides.|But when|you are secure|then establish|the (regular) prayer.|Indeed,|the prayer|is|on|the believers|prescribed|(at) fixed times.
And (do) not|be weak|in|pursuit|(of) the people.|If|you are|suffering,|then indeed, they|are (also) suffering|like what|you are suffering,|while you (have) hope|from|Allah|what|not|they hope.|And Allah is||All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
Indeed,|We (have) sent down|to you|the Book|with the truth|so that you may judge|between|the people|with what|Allah has shown you.||And (do) not|be|for the deceitful|a pleader.
And seek forgiveness|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And (do) not|argue|for|those who|deceive|themselves.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|(the one) who|is|treacherous|(and) sinful.
They seek to hide|from|the people|but they cannot hide||from|Allah|and He|(is) with them|when|they plot by night|what|He (does) not approve||of|the word.|And Allah is||of what|they do -|All-Encompassing.
Here you are -|those who|[you] argue|for them|in|the life|(of) the world,|but who|will argue|(with) Allah|for them|(on the) Day|(of) [the] Resurrection|or|who|will be|[over them]|(their) defender.
And whoever|does|evil|or|wrongs|his soul|then|seeks forgiveness|(of) Allah|he will find|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And whoever|earns|sin,|then only|he earns it|against|his soul.|And Allah is||All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And whoever|earns|a fault|or|a sin|then|throws|it|(on) an innocent,|then surely|he (has) burdened (himself)|(with) a slander|and a sin|manifest.
And if not|(for the) Grace of Allah||upon you|and His Mercy -|surely (had) resolved|a group|of them|to|mislead you.|But not|they mislead|except|themselves,|and not|they will harm you|(in) anything.||And Allah has sent down||to you|the Book|and [the] Wisdom|and taught you|what|you did not||know.|And is|(the) Grace|(of) Allah|upon you|great.
(There is) no|good|in|much|of|their secret talk|except|(he) who|orders|charity|or|kindness|or|conciliation|between|the people.|And who|does|that|seeking|pleasure|(of) Allah|then soon|We will give him|a reward|great.
And whoever|opposes|the Messenger|after||what|(has) become clear|to him|(of) the guidance,|and he follows|other than|(the) way|(of) the believers,|We will turn him|(to) what|he (has) turned|and We will burn him|(in) Hell|and evil it is|(as) a destination.
Indeed,|Allah|does not|forgive|that|partners be associated|with Him,|but He forgives|[what]|other than|that|for whom|He wills.|And whoever|associates partners|with Allah|then surely|he lost (the) way,|straying|far away.
Not|they invoke|besides Him||but|female (deities)|and not|they invoke|except|Shaitaan -|rebellious.
Allah cursed him||and he said,|"I will surely take|from|your slaves|a portion|appointed."
"And I will surely mislead them|and surely arouse desires in them,|and surely I will order them|so they will surely cut off|(the) ears|(of) the cattle|and surely I will order them|so they will surely change|(the) creation|(of) Allah."|And whoever|takes|the Shaitaan|(as) a friend||besides|Allah,|then surely|he (has) lost -|a loss|manifest.
He promises them|and arouses desires in them|and not|promises them|the Shaitaan -|except|deception.
Those -|their abode|(is) Hell|and not|they will find|from it|any escape.
And those who|believe[d]|and do|[the] righteous deeds|We will admit them|(in) Gardens|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers,|will abide|in it|forever.|A Promise|(of) Allah|(in) truth,|and who|(is) truer|than|Allah|(in) statement?
Not|by your desire|and not|(by the) desire|(of the) People|(of) the Book.|Whoever|does|evil|will be recompensed|for it|and not|he will find|for him|besides||Allah|any protector|and not|any helper.
And whoever|does|[of]|[the] righteous deeds|from|(the) male|or|female,|and he|(is) a believer,|then those|will enter|Paradise|and not|they will be wronged|(even as much as) the speck on a date-seed.
And  who|(is) better|(in) religion|than (one) who|submits|his face|to Allah|and he|(is) a good-doer|and follows|(the) religion|(of) Ibrahim|(the) upright?|And Allah took||Ibrahim|(as) a friend.
And for Allah|(is) what|(is) in|the heavens|and what|(is) in|the earth,|and is|Allah|of every|thing|All-Encompassing.
And they seek your ruling|concerning|the women.|Say,|"Allah|gives you the ruling|about them|and what|is recited|to you|in|the Book|concerning|orphans|[the] girls|(to) whom|you (do) not give them||what|is ordained|for them|and you desire|to|marry them,|and the ones who are weak|of|the children|and to|stand|for orphans|with justice.|And whatever|you do|of|good|then indeed,|Allah|is|about it|All-Knowing.
And if|a woman|fears|from|her husband|ill-conduct|or|desertion|then (there is) no|sin|on both of them|that|they make terms of peace|between themselves -|a reconciliation|and [the] reconciliation|(is) best.|And are swayed|the souls|(by) greed.|But if|you do good|and fear (Allah),|then indeed,|Allah|is|of what|you do|All-Aware.
And never|will you be able|to|deal justly|between|[the] women|even if|you desired,|but (do) not|incline|(with) all|the inclination|and leave her (the other)|like the suspended one.|And if|you reconcile|and fear (Allah)|then indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And if|they separate,|Allah will enrich||each (of them)|from|His abundance,|and Allah is||All-Encompassing,|All-Wise.
And for Allah|(is) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And surely|We have instructed|those who|were given|the Book|before you||and yourselves|that|you fear|Allah.|But if|you disbelieve -|then indeed|for Allah|(is) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And Allah is||Free of need,|Praiseworthy.
And for Allah|(is) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And Allah is sufficient||(as) a Disposer of affairs.
If|He wills|He can take you away|O people,||and bring|others.|And Allah is||over|that|All-Powerful.
Whoever|[is]|desires|reward|(of) the world -|then with|Allah|(is the) reward|(of) the world|and the Hereafter.|And Allah is||All-Hearing,|All-Seeing.
O you|who|believe[d] |Be|custodians|of justice|(as) witnesses|to Allah,|even if|(it is) against|yourselves|or|the parents|and the relatives.|if|he be|rich|or|poor,|for Allah|(is) nearer|to both of them.|So (do) not|follow|the desire|lest|you deviate.|And if|you distort|or|refrain,|then indeed,|Allah|is|of what|you do|All-Aware.
O you|who|believe[d] |Believe|in Allah|and His Messenger,|and the Book|which|He revealed|upon|His Messenger|and the Book|which|He revealed|before.||And whoever|disbelieves|in Allah|and His Angels,|and His Books,|and His Messengers|and the Day|the Last,|then surely|he (has) lost (the) way,|straying|far away.
Indeed,|those who|believed,|then|disbelieved,|then|(again) believed,|then|disbelieved,|then|increased|(in) disbelief -|not|will|Allah|forgive|[for] them|and not|will guide them|(to) a (right) way.
Give tidings|(to) the hypocrites|that|for them|(is) a punishment|painful -
Those who|take|the disbelievers|(as) allies|instead of||the believers.|Do they seek|with them|the honor?|But indeed,|the honor|(is) all for Allah.|
And surely|He has revealed|to you|in|the Book|that|when|you hear|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|being rejected|[it]|and ridiculed|at [it],|then do not|sit|with them|until|they engage|in|a conversation|other than that.|Indeed, you|then,|(would be) like them.|Indeed,|Allah|will gather|the hypocrites|and the disbelievers|in|Hell|all together.
Those who|are waiting|for you.|Then if|was|for you|a victory|from|Allah|they say,|"Were not|we|with you?"|But if|(there) was|for the disbelievers|a chance|they said,|"Did not|we have advantage|over you|and we protected you|from|the believers?"|And Allah|will judge|between you|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|and never|will Allah make||for the disbelievers|over|the believers|a way.
Indeed,|the hypocrites|(seek to) deceive|Allah|and (it is) He|who deceives them.|And when|they stand|for|the prayer,|they stand|lazily,|showing off|(to) the people|and not|they remember|Allah|except|a little.
Wavering|between|that,|not|to|these|and not|to|those.|And whoever|Allah lets go astray -||then never|you will find|for him|a way.
O you|who|believe[d] |(Do) not|take|the disbelievers|(as) allies|instead of||the believers.|Do you wish|that|you make|for Allah|against you|an evidence|clear?
Indeed,|the hypocrites|(will be) in|the lowest depths||of|the Fire,|and never|you will find|for them|any helper
Except|those who|repent|and correct (themselves)|and hold fast|to Allah|and are sincere|(in) their religion|for Allah,|then those (will be)|with|the believers.|And soon|Allah will give||the believers|a great reward.|
What|would Allah do||by punishing you|if|you are grateful|and you believe?|And Allah is||All-Appreciative,|All-Knowing.
(Does) not|love|Allah|the public mention of [the] evil||[of]|[the] words|except|(by the one) who|has been wronged.|And Allah is||All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
If|you disclose|a good|or|you conceal it|or|pardon|[of]|an evil,|then indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Pardoning,|All-Powerful.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|in Allah|and His Messengers|and they wish|that|they differentiate|between|Allah|and His Messengers|and they say,|"We believe|in some|and we disbelieve|in others."|And they wish|that|they take|between|that|a way.
Those -|they|(are) the disbelievers|truly.|And We have prepared|for the disbelievers|a punishment|humiliating.
And those who|believe|in Allah|and His Messengers|and not|they differentiate|between|(any) one|of them,|those -|soon|He will give them|their reward.|And Allah is||Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Ask you|(the) People|(of) the Book|that|you bring down|to them|a book|from|the heaven.|Then indeed,|they (had) asked|Musa|greater|than|that|for they said,|"Show us|Allah|manifestly,"|so struck them|the thunderbolt|for their wrongdoing.|Then|they took|the calf (for worship)|after||[what]|came to them|the clear proofs,|then We forgave them|for|that.|And We gave|Musa|an authority|clear.
And We raised|over them|the mount|for their covenant,|and We said|to them,|"Enter|the gate,|prostrating."|And We said|to them.|"(Do) not|transgress|in|the Sabbath."|And We took|from them|a covenant|solemn.
Then because of|their breaking|(of) their covenant|and their disbelief|in (the) Signs|(of) Allah|and their killing|(of) the Prophets|without|any right|and their saying,|"Our hearts|(are) wrapped."|Nay,|Allah (has) set a seal||on their (hearts)|for their disbelief|so not|they believe|except|a few.
And for their disbelief|and their saying|against|Maryam|a slander|great.
And for their saying,|"Indeed, we|killed|the Messiah,|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|(the) Messenger|(of) Allah."|And not|they killed him|and not|they crucified him|but|it was made to appear (so)|to them.|And indeed,|those who|differ|in it|(are) surely in|doubt|about it.|Not|for them|about it|[of]|(any) knowledge|except|(the) following|(of) assumption.|And not|they killed him,|certainly.
Nay,|Allah raised him||towards Him.|And Allah is||All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
And (there is) not|from|(the) People|(of) the Book|but|surely he believes|in him|before|his death.|And (on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|he will be|against them|a witness.
Then for (the) wrongdoing|of|those who|were Jews,|We made unlawful|for them|good things|which had been lawful|for them|and for their hindering|from|(the) way|(of) Allah -|many.
And for their taking|(of) [the] usury|while certainly|they were forbidden|from it|and (for) their consuming|wealth|(of) the people|wrongfully.|And We have prepared|for the disbelievers|among them|a punishment|painful.
But|the ones who are firm|in|the knowledge|among them|and the believers|believe|in what|(is) revealed|to you|and what|was revealed|before you.||And the ones who establish|the prayer|and the ones who give|the zakah|and the ones who believe|in Allah|and the Day|the Last -|those,|We will give them|a great reward.|
Indeed, We|have revealed|to you|as|We revealed|to|Nuh|and the Prophets|after him,||and We revealed|to|Ibrahim|and Ismail,|and Ishaq|and Yaqub,|and the tribes,|and Isa|and Ayub,|and Yunus,|and Harun|and Sulaiman|and We gave|(to) Dawood|the Zaboor.
And Messengers|surely|We (have) mentioned them|to you|before||and Messengers|not|We (have) mentioned them|to you.|And Allah spoke|(to) Musa||(in a) conversation.
Messengers,|bearers of glad tidings|and warners,|so that not|there is|for the mankind|against|Allah|any argument|after|the Messengers.|And Allah is||All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
But|Allah|bears witness|to what|He (has) revealed|to you.|He has sent it down|with His Knowledge|and the Angels|bear witness.|And Allah is sufficient||(as) a Witness.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|and hinder|from|(the) way|(of) Allah,|surely|they have strayed,|straying|far away.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved|and did wrong,|Allah will not|||[to] forgive|them|and not|He will guide them|(to) a way,
Except|(the) way|(to) Hell,|abiding|in it|forever.|And that is||for|Allah|easy.
O|mankind |Surely|has come to you|the Messenger|with the truth|from|your Lord|so believe,|(it is) better|for you.|But if|you disbelieve,|then indeed,|to Allah (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|And Allah is||All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
O People|(of) the Book |(Do) not|commit excess|in|your religion|and (do) not|say|about|Allah|except|the truth.|Only|the Messiah,|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|(was) a Messenger of Allah||and His word|which He conveyed|to|Maryam|and a spirit|from Him.|So believe|in Allah|and His Messengers.|And (do) not|say,|"Three;"|desist|(it is) better|for you.|Only|Allah|(is) God|One.|Glory be to Him |That|He (should) have|for Him|a son.|To Him (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And Allah (is) sufficient||(as) a Disposer of affairs.
Never|will disdain|the Messiah|to|be|a slave|of Allah|and not|the Angels,|the ones who are near (to Allah).|And whoever|disdains|from|His worship|and is arrogant|then He will gather them|towards Him|all together.
Then as for|those who|believed|and did|the righteous deeds|then He will give them in full|their reward|and give them more|from|His Bounty.|And as for|those who|disdained|and were arrogant|then He will punish them|(with) a punishment|painful,|and they will not find||for themselves||besides Allah||any protector|and not|any helper.
O mankind ||Surely|has come to you|a convincing proof|from|your Lord,|and  We (have) sent down|to you|a clear light.|
So as for|those who|believed|in Allah|and held fast|to Him,|then He will admit them|in|Mercy|from Himself|and Bounty|and will guide them|to Himself|(on) a straight way.|
They seek your ruling.|Say,|"Allah|gives you a ruling|concerning|the Kalala.|if|a man|died|(and) not|he has|a child|and he has|a sister,|then for her|(is) a half|(of) what|he left.|And he|will inherit from her|if|not|is|for her|a child.|But if|there were|two females|then for them|two thirds|of what|he left.|But if|they were|brothers and sisters|men|and women,|then the male will have|like|share|(of) the two females.|Allah makes clear||to you|lest|you go astray.|And Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
O you|who|believe |Fulfil|the contracts.|Are made lawful|for you|the quadruped|(of) the grazing livestock|except|what|is recited|on you,|not|being permitted|(to) hunt|while you|(are in) Ihram.|Indeed,|Allah|decrees|what|He wills.
O you|who|believe |(Do) not|violate|(the) rites|(of) Allah,|and not|the sacred month||and not|the sacrificial animals|and not|the garlanded|and not|(those) coming|(to) the Sacred House||seeking|Bounty|of|their Lord|and good pleasure.|And when|you come out of Ihram|then (you may) hunt.|And let not incite you||(the) hatred|(for) a people|as|they stopped you|from|Al-Masjid Al-Haraam||that|you commit transgression.|And help one another|in|[the] righteousness|and [the] piety,|but (do) not|help one another|in|[the] sin|and [the] transgression.|And fear|Allah;|indeed,|Allah|(is) severe|(in) [the] punishment.
Are made unlawful|on you|the dead animals,|and the blood,|and flesh|(of) the swine,|and what|has been dedicated|to other than|Allah,|[on it],|and that which is strangled (to death),|and that which is hit fatally,|and that which has a fatal fall,|and that which is gored by horns,|and that which|ate (it)|the wild animal|except|what|you slaughtered,|and what|is sacrificed|on|the stone altars,|and that|you seek division|by divining arrows -|that|(is) grave disobedience.|This day|(have) despaired|those who|disbelieved|of|your religion,|so (do) not|fear them,|but fear Me.|This day|I have perfected|for you|your religion|and I have completed|upon you|My Favor|and I have approved|for you|[the] Islam|(as) a religion.|But whoever|(is) forced|by|hunger|(and) not|inclining|to sin,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
They ask you|what|(is) made lawful|for them.|Say,|"Are made lawful|for you|the good things|and what|you have taught|to (your) hunting animals,||ones who train animals to hunt,|you teach them|of what|Allah has taught you.||So eat|of what|they catch|for you,|but mention|(the) name|(of) Allah|on it,|and fear|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|is swift|(in taking) account.
This day|are made lawful|for you|the good things;|and (the) food|(of) those who|were given|the Book|(is) lawful|for you,|and your food|(is) lawful|for them.|And the chaste women|from|the believers|and the chaste women|from|those who|were given|the Book|before you,||when|you have given them|their bridal due,|being chaste|not|being lewd|and not|ones (who are) taking|secret lovers.|And whoever|denies|the faith -|then surely|(are) wasted|his deeds|and he,|in|the Hereafter,|(will be) among|the losers.
O you|who|believe |When|you stand up|for|the prayer,|then wash|your faces|and your hands|till|the elbows|and wipe|your heads|and your feet|till|the ankles.|But if|you are|(in) a state of ceremonial impurity|then purify yourselves.|But if|you are|ill|or|on|a journey|or|has come|any one|of you|from|the toilet|or|has (had) contact|(with) the women|and not|you find|water,|then do tayyammum|(with) earth|clean,|then wipe|your faces|and your hands|with it.|Allah (does) not intend|||to make|for you|any|difficulty|but|He intends|to purify you|and to complete|His Favor|upon you|so that you may|(be) grateful.
And remember|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|upon you|and His covenant|which|He bound you|with [it]|when|you said,|"We heared|and we obeyed;"|and fear|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knower|of what|(is in) the breasts.
O you|who|believe |Be|steadfast|for Allah|(as) witnesses|in justice,|and let not prevent you||hatred|(of) a people|[upon]|that not|you do justice.|Be just|it|(is) nearer|to [the] piety.|And fear|Allah;|indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do.
Allah has promised||those who|believe|and do|the righteous deeds -|for them|(is) forgiveness|and a reward|great.
And those who|disbelieve|and deny|Our Signs -|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Hellfire.
O you|who|believe |Remember|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|upon you|when|(were) determined|a people|[to]|stretch|towards you|their hands,|but He restrained|their hands|from you.|And fear|Allah.|And upon|Allah|so let put the trust|the believers.
And certainly|Allah took||a Covenant|(from the) Children|(of) Israel|and We appointed|among them|twelve||leaders.|And Allah said,||"Indeed, I (am)|with you,|if|you establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah|and you believe|in My Messengers|and you assist them|and you loan|(to) Allah|a goodly loan,||surely I will remove|from you|your evil deeds|and I will surely admit you|(to) gardens|flow|from|underneath them|the rivers.|But whoever|disbelieved|after|that|among you,|then certainly|he strayed|(from) the right way.|
So for|their breaking|(of) their covenant|We cursed them|and We made|their hearts|hard.|They distort|the words|from|their places,|and forgot|a part|of what|they were reminded|of [it].|And you will not cease||to discover||treachery|from them|except|a few|of them.|But forgive|them|and overlook.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|the good-doers.
And from|those who|said,|Indeed we|(are) Christians,"|We took|their covenant;|but they forgot|a part|of what|they were reminded|of [it].|So We aroused|between them|[the] enmity|and [the] hatred|till|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|And soon|Allah will inform them||of what|they used to|do.
O People|(of) the Book |Surely|has come to you|Our Messenger|making clear|to you|much|of what|you used to|conceal|of|the Scripture|and overlooking||much.|Surely|has come to you|from|Allah|a light|and a clear Book|
Guides|with it|Allah|(those) who|seek|His pleasure|(to the) ways|(of) the peace,|and brings them out|from|the darkness[es]|to|the light|by His permission,|and guides them|to|(the) straight way.|
Certainly|disbelieved -|those who|said,|"Indeed,|Allah,|He|(is) the Messiah,|son|(of) Maryam."|Say,|"Then who|has power|against|Allah|(in) anything|if|He intends|to|destroy|the Messiah,|son|(of) Maryam,|and his mother|and whoever|(is) in|the earth|all?"|And for Allah|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and what|(is) between both of them.|He creates|what|He wills,|and Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And said,|the Jews|and the Christians|"We (are)|(the) children|(of) Allah|and His beloved."|Say,|"Then why|(does He) punish you|for your sins?"|Nay,|you (are)|human beings|from among (those)|He created.|He forgives|[for] whom|He wills|and punishes|whom|He wills.|And for Allah|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them,|and to Him|(is) the final return.
O People|(of) the Book |Surely|has come to you|Our Messenger,|he makes clear|to you|[on]|(after) an interval (of cessation)|of|the Messengers,|lest|you say|"Not|(has) come to us|any|bearer of glad tidings|and not|a warner."|But surely|has come to you|a bearer of glad tidings|and a warner.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And when|Musa said||to his people,|"O my people,|remember|(the) Favor of Allah||upon you|when|He placed|among you|Prophets|and made you|kings|and He gave you|what|He (had) not given||(to) anyone|from|the worlds.
"O my people |Enter|the Holy land||which|Allah has ordained||for you|and (do) not|turn|on|your backs,|then you will turn back|(as) losers."
They said,|"O Musa |Indeed,|in it|(are) people|(of) tyrannical strength|and indeed, we|never|will enter it|until|they leave|from it,|and if|they leave|[from] it|then certainly we (will)|enter (it)."
Said|two men|from|those who|feared (Allah),|Allah had Favored||[on] both of them,|"Enter|upon them|(through) the gate|then when|you have entered it|then indeed, you (will be)|victorious.|And upon|Allah|then put your trust|if|you are|believers.
They said,|O Musa |Indeed, we|never|will enter it,|ever,|as long as they are||in it.|So go|you|and your Lord|and you both fight.|Indeed, we|are [here]|sitting."
He said|"O my Lord |Indeed, I|(do) not|(have) power|except|(over) myself|and my brother,|so (make a) separation|between us|and between|the defiantly disobedient people."|
(Allah) said,|"Then indeed it|(will be) forbidden|to them|(for) forty|years,|they will wander|in|the earth.|So (do) not|grieve|over|the defiantly disobedient people."|
And recite|to them|the story|(of) two sons|(of) Adam,|in truth,|when|both offered|a sacrifice,|and it was accepted|from|one of them|and not|was accepted|from|the other.|Said (the latter),|"Surely I will kill you."|Said (the former),|"Only|Allah accepts||from|the God fearing.
If|you stretch|towards me|your hand|to kill me,|I will not||stretch|my hand|towards you|to kill you,|indeed I|fear|Allah|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds."
"Indeed, I|wish|that|you be laden|with my sin|and your sin|so you will be|among|(the) companions|(of) the Fire,|and that|(is the) recompense|(of) the wrong-doers."
Then prompted|to him|his soul|(to) kill|his brother,|so he killed him|and became|of|the losers.
Then Allah sent||a crow,|it (was) scratching|in|the earth|to show him|how|to hide|(the) dead body|(of) his brother.|He said,|"Woe to me |Am I unable|that|I can be|like|this|[the] crow|and hide|(the) dead body|(of) my brother?"|Then he became|of|the regretful.
From time||that,|We ordained|on|(the) Children|(of) Israel|that he|who|kills|a person|other than|(for) a life|or|(for) spreading corruption|in|the earth|then (it) is as if|he has killed|all [the] mankind,||and whoever|saves it|then (it) is as if|he has saved|all [the] mankind.||And surely|came to them|Our Messengers|with clear Signs|yet,|indeed,|many|of them|after|that|in|the earth|(are) surely those who commit excesses.
Only|(the) recompense|(for) those who|wage war|(against) Allah|and His Messenger|and strive|in|the earth|spreading corruption|(is) that|they be killed|or|they be crucified|or|be cut off|their hands|and their feet|of|opposite sides|or|they be exiled|from|the land.|That|(is) for them|disgrace|in|the world|and for them|in|the Hereafter|(is) a punishment|great.
Except|those who|repent|before||that|you overpower|[over] them,|then know|that|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
O you|who|believe |Fear|Allah|and seek|towards Him|the means|and strive hard|in|His way,|so that you may|succeed.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve,|if|that|for them|(is) what|(is) in|the earth|all|and the like of it|with it,|to ransom themselves|with it,|from|(the) punishment|(of the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|not|will be accepted|from them,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
They will wish|that|they come out|of|the Fire|but not|they|will come out|of it.|And for them|(is) a punishment|lasting.
And (for) the male thief|and the female thief -|[then] cut off|their hands|(as) a recompense|for what|they earned|(as) an exemplary (punishment)|from|Allah.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
But whoever|repented|after||his wrongdoing|and reforms,|then indeed,|Allah|will turn in forgiveness to him.||Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Do not|you know|that|Allah,|to Him (belongs)|the dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth?|He punishes|whom|He wills|and He forgives|[to] whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
O Messenger ||Let not grieve you||those who|hasten|in (to)|[the] disbelief -|of|those who|said,|"We believe"|with their mouths|and not|believe|their hearts,|and from|those who|(are) Jews.|They (are) listeners|to falsehood,|(and) listeners|for other people||(who have) not come to you.||They distort|the words|[after] (from)||their context,|saying,|"If|you are given|this|[so] take it|but if|you are not given it||then beware."|And (for) whom|Allah intends||his trial ,|then never|will you have power|for him|against|Allah|anything.|Those|(are) the ones|never|will Allah intend||that|He purifies|their hearts.|For them|in|the world|(is) disgrace|and for them|in|the Hereafter|(is) a punishment|great.
Listeners|to [the] falsehood,|devourers|of the forbidden.|So if|they come to you|then judge|between them|or|turn away|from them.|And if|you turn away|from them,|then never|will they harm you|(in) anything.|And if|you judge,|then judge|between them|with [the] justice.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|the ones who are just.
But how can|they appoint you a judge|while they (have) with them|the Taurat,|in it|(is the) Command|(of) Allah?|Then|they turn away|after||that,|and not|those|(are) the believers.
Indeed,|We revealed|the Taurat|in it|(was) Guidance|and light;|judged|by it|the Prophets,|those who|had submitted (to Allah)|for those who|were Jews,|and the Rabbis,|and the scholars,|with what|they were entrusted|of|(the) Book|(of) Allah|and they were|to it|witnesses.|So (do) not|fear|the people|but fear Me,|and (do) not|sell|My Verses|(for) a little price.||And whoever|(does) not|judge|by what|Allah has revealed,||then those|[they]|(are) the disbelievers.
And We ordained|for them|in it|that -|the life|for the life,|and the eye|for the eye,|and the nose|for the nose,|and the ear|for the ear,|and the tooth|for the tooth,|and (for) wounds|(is) retribution.|But whoever|gives it (as) charity,||then it is|an expiation|for him.|And whoever|(does) not|judge|by what|Allah has revealed,||then those|[they]|(are) the wrongdoers.
And  We sent|on|their footsteps|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|confirming|what|(was) before him||of|the Taurat,|and We gave him|the Injeel,|in it|(was) Guidance|and light|and confirming|what|(was) before him||of|the Taurat|and a Guidance|and an admonition|for the God conscious.
And let judge|(the) People|(of) the Injeel|by what|Allah has revealed||in it.|And whoever|(does) not|judge|by what|Allah revealed||then those|[they] (are)|the defiantly disobedient.
And We revealed|to you|the Book|in [the] truth,|confirming|what|(was) before it||of|the Book|and a guardian|over it.|So judge|between them|by what|Allah has revealed||and (do) not|follow|their vain desires|when|has come to you|of|the truth.|For each|We have made|for you|a law|and a clear way.|And if|Allah (had) willed||He (would have) made you|one community||[and] but|to test you|in|what|He (has) given you,|so race|(to) the good.|To|Allah|you will all return,||then He will inform you|of what|you were|concerning it|differing.
And that|you judge|between them|by what|Allah (has) revealed||and (do) not|follow|their vain desires|and beware of them|lest|they tempt you away|from|some|(of) what|Allah has revealed||to you.|And if|they turn away|then know that|only|Allah intends||to|afflict them|for some|(of) their sins.|And indeed,|many|of|the people|(are) defiantly disobedient.
Is it then the judgment|of [the] ignorance|they seek?|And who (is)|better|than|Allah|(in) judgment|for a people|(who) firmly believe.
O you|who|believe |(Do) not|take|the Jews|and the Christians|(as) allies.|Some of them|(are) allies|(to) others.|And whoever|takes them as allies|among you,|then indeed, he|(is) of them.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|the wrongdoing people.|
And you see|those -|in|their hearts|(is) a disease|they hasten|to them|saying,|"We fear|that|(may) strike us|a misfortune."|But perhaps|Allah|[that]|will bring|the victory|or|a decision|from Him.||Then they will become|for|what|they had concealed|within|themselves,|regretful.
And will say|those who|believe,|"Are these|those who|swore|by Allah|strongest,|(of) their oaths,|indeed, they|(were) with you?"|Became worthless|their deeds,|and they became|(the) losers.
O you|who|believe |Whoever|turns back|among you|from|his religion,|then soon|Allah (will) bring||a people|whom He loves|and they love Him,|humble|towards|the believers|(and) stern|towards|the disbelievers;|striving|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and not|fearing|the blame|(of) a critic.|That|(is the) Grace|(of) Allah,|He grants|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.
Only|your ally|(is) Allah|and His Messenger,|and those who|believe,|and those who|establish|the prayer|and give|zakah|and they|(are) those who bow down.
And whoever|takes as an ally|Allah|and His Messenger|and those who|believe,|then indeed.|(the) party|(of) Allah|they|(are) the victorious.
O you|who|believe |(Do) not|take|those who|take|your religion|(in) ridicule|and fun|from|those who|are given|the Book|before you||and the disbelievers|(as) allies.|And fear|Allah,|if|you are|believers.
And when|you make a call|for|the prayer,|they take it|(in) ridicule|and fun.|That|(is) because they|(are) a people|(who do) not|understand.
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book |Do|you resent|[of] us|except|that|we believe|in Allah|and what|has been revealed|to us|and what|was revealed|before,||and that|most of you|(are) defiantly disobedient.
Say,|"Shall|I inform you|(of) worse|than|that|(as) recompense|from|Allah?|Whom|Allah has cursed||and He became angry|with him|and made|of them|[the] apes|and [the] swines,|and (who) worshipped|the false deities.|Those|(are) worse|(in) position|and farthest astray|from|(the) even|way."
And when|they come to you|they say,|"We believe."|But certainly|they entered|with disbelief|and they|certainly|went out|with it.|And Allah|knows best|[of] what|they were|hiding.
And you see|many|of them|hastening|into|[the] sin|and [the] transgression|and eating|the forbidden.|Surely evil|(is) what|they were|doing.
Why (do) not|forbid them,|the Rabbis|and the religious scholars|from|their saying|the sinful|and their eating|(of) the forbidden?|Surely, evil|(is) what|they used to|do.
And the Jews said,||"Allah's Hand||(is) chained."|Are chained|their hands,|and they have been cursed|for what|they said.|Nay,|His Hands|(are) stretched out|He spends|how|He wills.|And surely increase|many|of them,|what|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord,|(in) rebellion|and disbelief.|And We have cast|among them|[the] enmity|and [the] hatred|till|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|Every time|they kindled|(the) fire|of [the] war,|Allah extinguished it.||And they strive|in|the earth|spreading corruption.|And Allah|(does) not|love|the corrupters.
And if|that|(the) People|(of) the Book|(had) believed|and feared (Allah),|surely We (would have) removed|from them|their evil (deeds)|and surely We (would have) admitted them|[to] Gardens|(of) Bliss.
And if|that they|had stood fast|(by) the Taurat|and the Injeel|and what|was revealed|to them|from|their Lord,|surely they (would have) eaten|from|above them|and from|beneath|their feet.|Among them|(is) a community|moderate,|but many|of them -|evil|(is) what|they do.
O|Messenger |Convey|what|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord,|and if|not|you do|then not|you (have) conveyed|His Message.|And Allah|will protect you|from|the people.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|the disbelieving people.|
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book |You are not|on|anything|until|you stand fast|(by) the Taurat|and the Injeel|and what|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord.|And surely increase|many|of them,|what|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord,|(in) rebellion|and disbelief.|So (do) not|grieve|over|the disbelieving people.|
Indeed,|those who|believed|and those who|became Jews|and the Sabians|and the Christians,|whoever|believed|in Allah|and the Last Day||and did|good deeds,|then no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
Certainly|We took|a Covenant|(from the) Children|(of) Israel|and We sent|to them|Messengers.|Whenever|came to them|any Messenger|with what|not|desired|their souls,|a group|they denied|and a group|they kill.
And they thought|that not|will be (for them)|a trial,|so they became blind|and they became deaf.|Then|Allah turned||to them|then (again)|they became blind|and they became deaf,|many|of them.|And Allah|(is) All-Seer|of what|they do.
Certainly|disbelieved|those who|say,|"Indeed|Allah -|He|(is) the Messiah,|son|(of) Maryam."|While said|the Messiah,|"O Children|(of) Israel |Worship|Allah,|my Lord|and your Lord."|Indeed, he|who|associates partners|with Allah,|then surely|Allah (has) forbidden||for him|Paradise|and his abode|(will be) the Fire.|And not|for the wrongdoers|of|(any) helpers.
Certainly|disbelieved|those who|say,|"Indeed|Allah|(is the) third|(of) three."|And (there is) no|[of]|god|except|(the) One God.||And if|not|they desist|from what|they are saying|surely will afflict|those who|disbelieved|among them,|a punishment|painful.
So will not|they repent|to|Allah|and seek His forgiveness?|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Not|(is) the Messiah,|son|(of) Maryam|but|a Messenger,|certainly|had passed|before him||the Messengers.|And his mother|(was) truthful.|They both used to|eat|[the] food.|See|how|We make clear|to them|the Signs,|then|see|how|they are deluded.
Say,|"Do you worship|besides||Allah|what|not|has power|to (cause) you|any harm|and not|any benefit,|while Allah,|He|(is) the All-Hearing,|the All-Knowing?
Say,|"O People|(of) the Book |(Do) not|exceed|in|your religion|other than|the truth,|and (do) not|follow|(vain) desires|(of) a people|certainly|who went astray|before,||and they misled|many,|and they have strayed|from|(the) right|[the] way.
Were cursed|those who|disbelieved|from|(the) Children|(of) Israel|by|(the) tongue|(of) Dawood|and Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|that (was)|because|they disobeyed|and they were|transgressing.
They had not been||forbidding each other|from|wrongdoing|they did [it].|Surely, evil|(was) what|they were|doing.
You see|many|of them|taking as allies|those who|disbelieved.|Surely evil|(is) what|sent forth|for them|their souls,|that|Allah became angry||with them|and in|the punishment|they|(will) abide forever.
And if|they had|believed|in Allah|and the Prophet|and what|has been revealed|to him,|not|they (would have) taken them|(as) allies;|[and] but|many|of them|(are) defiantly disobedient.
Surely you will find|strongest|(of) the people|(in) enmity|to those who|believe,|the Jews|and those who|(are) polytheists;|and surely you will find|nearest of them|(in) affection|to those who|believe,|those who|say,|"We|(are) Christians."|That (is)|because|among them|(are) priests|and monks,|and that they|(are) not|arrogant.
And when|they listen|(to) what|has been revealed|to|the Messenger,|you see|their eyes|overflowing|with|the tears,|for what|they recognized|of|the truth.|They say,|"Our Lord,|we have believed|so write us|with|the witnesses.
And what|for us (that)|not|we believe|in Allah|and what|came (to) us|from|the truth?|And we hope|that|will admit us|our Lord|with|the righteous people."|
So Allah rewarded them||for what|they said|(with) Gardens|flows|from|underneath them|the rivers,|will abide forever|in it.|And that|(is the) reward|(of) the good-doers.
And those who|disbelieved|and denied|Our Signs,|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Hellfire.
O you|who|believe |(Do) not|make unlawful|(the) good things|(of) what|Allah has made lawful||for you,|and (do) not|transgress.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|the transgressors.
And eat|of what|Allah has provided you -||lawful|good.|And fear Allah,||the One|in Him you (are)||believers.
Allah will not call you to account|||for the thoughtless utterances|in|your oaths|but|He will call you to account|for what|you contracted|(of) the oath.|So its expiation|(is) feeding|(of) ten|needy people|of|average|(of) what|you feed|your families|or|clothing them|or|freeing|a slave.|But whoever|(does) not|find|(that), then fasting|(for) three|days.|That|(is the) expiation|(of) your oaths|when|you have sworn.|And guard|your oaths.|Thus|Allah makes clear||to you|His Verses|so that you may|(be) grateful.
O you|who|believe |Verily|the intoxicants|and [the] games of chance|and (sacrifices at) altars|and divining arrows|(are an) abomination|from|(the) work|(of) the Shaitaan,|so avoid it|so that you may|(be) successful.
Only|the Shaitaan intends||to|cause|between you|[the] enmity|and [the] hatred|through|intoxicants|and gambling,|and hinders you|from|(the) remembrance|(of) Allah|and from|the prayer.|So will you be||the ones who abstain?
And obey|Allah|and obey|the Messenger|and beware.|And if|you turn away,|then know|only|upon|Our Messenger|(is to) clearly convey (the Message).|
Not|on|those who|believe|and do|the good deeds|any sin|for what|they ate|when||they fear (Allah)|and they believe|and they do|[the] good deeds|then|they fear (Allah)|and believe,|then|they fear (Allah)|and do good,|and Allah|loves|the good-doers.
O you|who|believe |Surely Allah will test you||through something|of|the game -|can reach it|your hands|and your spears|that Allah may make evident||who|fears Him|in the unseen.|And whoever|transgressed|after|that,|then for him|(is) a punishment|painful.
O you|who|believe |(Do) not|kill|the game|while you|(are in) Ihram.|And whoever|killed it|among you|intentionally,|then penalty|(is) similar|(to) what|he killed|of|the cattle,|judging|it|two just men||among you|(as) an offering|reaching|the Kabah|or|an expiation -|feeding|needy people|or|equivalent|(of) that|(in) fasting,|that he may taste|(the) consequence|(of) his deed.|Allah pardoned||what|(has) passed,|but whoever|returned,|then Allah will take retribution||from him.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|Owner|(of) Retribution.
Is made lawful|for you|game|(of) the sea|and its food|(as) provision|for you|and for the travelers,|and is made unlawful|on you|game|(of) the land|as long as you||(are) in Ihram,|And be conscious of Allah||the One|to Him|you will be gathered.
Allah has made||the Kabah,|the Sacred House,||an establishment|for mankind|and the month(s)|[the] sacred|and the (animals) for offering|and the garlands.|That (is)|so that you may know|that|Allah|knows|what|(is) in|the heavens|and what|(is) in|the earth,|and that|Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knowing.
Know|that|Allah|(is) severe|(in) punishment|and that|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Not|on|the Messenger|except|the conveyance.|And Allah|knows|what|you reveal|and what|you conceal.
Say,|"Not|(are) equal|the evil|and the good|even if|impresses you|abundance|(of) the evil.|So fear|Allah,|O men|(of) understanding,|so that you may|be successful."
O you|who|believe |(Do) not|ask|about|things|if|made clear|to you,|it may distress you|and if|you ask|about it|when|the Quran is being revealed||it would be made clear|to you.|Allah has pardoned||[about] it,|and Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|All-Forbearing.
Indeed,|asked them|a people||before you,|then|they became|thereby|disbelievers.
Allah has not made|||of|a Bahirah|and not|a Saibah|and not|a Wasilah|and not|a Hami.|[And] but|those who|disbelieved|they invent|against|Allah|the lie,|and most of them|(do) not|use reason.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Come|to|what|Allah has revealed||and to|the Messenger,"|they said,|"Sufficient for us|(is) what|we found|upon it|our forefathers."|Even though|their forefathers were||not|knowing|anything|and not|they (were) guided?
O you|who|believe |Upon you|(is to guard) yourselves.|Will not harm you||(those) who|(have gone) astray|when|you have been guided.|To|Allah|(is) your return -|all;|then He will inform you|of what|you used to|do.
O you|who|believe |(Take) testimony|among you|when|approaches|one of you|[the] death,|(at the) time (of making)|[the] a will|two|just men||among you,|or|two others|from|other than you|if|you|(are) travel(ing)|in|the earth|then befalls you|calamity|(of) [the] death.|Detain both of them|after||the prayer|and let them both swear|by Allah|if|you doubt,|"We will not exchange||it for|a price|even if|he is|a near relative,||and not|we will conceal|testimony|(of) Allah.|Indeed, we|then|(will) surely (be) of|the sinners."
Then if|it is discovered||that the two|(were) guilty|(of) sin,|then (let) two others|stand|(in) their place|from|those who|have a lawful right over them -||the former two -|and let them both swear|by Allah|"Surely our testimony|(is) truer|than|testimony of the other two|and not|we have transgressed.|Indeed, we|then|(will be) of|the wrongdoers."
That|(is) closer|that|they will give|the testimony|in its (true) form||or|they would fear|that|will be refuted|their oaths|after|their (others) oaths.|And fear|Allah|and listen;|and Allah|(does) not|guide|the defiantly disobedient people.|
(The) day|Allah will gather||the Messengers|and He will say,|"What|was (the) response you received?"|They said,|"(There is) no|knowledge|for us.|Indeed You,|You|(are the) Knower|(of) the unseen."
When|Allah said,||"O Isa,|son|(of) Maryam |Remember|My Favor|upon you|and upon|your mother|when|I strengthened you|with the Holy Spirit,||you spoke|(to) the people|in|the cradle|and (in) maturity.|And when|I taught you|the Book|and the wisdom|and the Taurat|and the Injeel;|and when|you make|from|the clay|like the shape|(of) the bird|by My permission|then you breath|into it|and it becomes|a bird|by My permission,|and you heal|the born blind|and the leper|by My permission,|and when|you bring forth|the dead|by My permission.|And when|I restrained|(the) Children|(of) Israel|from you|when|you came to them|with the clear proofs|then said|those who|disbelieved|among them|'This is not||but|clear magic."'|
And when|I inspired|to|the disciples|to|believe|in Me|and in My Messenger|they said,|"We believe|and bear witness|that indeed we|(are) Muslims.
When|the disciples said,||"O Isa,|son|(of) Maryam |Is|your Lord able||to|send down|to us|a table spread|from|the heaven?"|He said,|"Fear|Allah,|if|you are|believers."
They said,|"We wish|that|we eat|from it|and satisfy|our hearts|and we know|that|certainly|you have spoken the truth to us|and we be|over it|among|the witnesses.
Said|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|"O Allah,|our Lord,|send down|to us|a table spread|from|the heaven|to be|for us|a festival|for first of us|and last of us|and a sign|from You.|And provide us,|and You|(are) best|(of) the providers.
Allah said,||"Indeed I|(will) send it down|to you,|then whoever|disbelieves|after (that)|among you,|then indeed I|[I] will punish him|(with) a punishment|not|I have punished|anyone|among|the worlds."
And when|Allah said,||"O Isa,|son|(of) Maryam |Did you|say|to the people,|'Take me|and my mother|(as) two gods|besides||Allah?'"|He said,|"Glory be to You |Not|was|for me|that|I say|what|not|I|(had) right.|If|I had|said it,|then surely|You would have known it.|You know|what|(is) in|myself,|and not|I know|what|(is) in|Yourself.|Indeed, You,|You|(are) All-Knower|(of) the unseen.
Not I said||to them|except|what|You commanded me|[with it]|that|'You worship|Allah,|my Lord|and your Lord.'|And I was|over them|a witness|as long as I||(was) among them,|then when|You raised me|You were|[You]|the Watcher|over them,|and You|(are) on|every|thing|a Witness.
If|You punish them,|then indeed they|(are) Your slaves,|and if|You forgive|[for] them|then indeed You,|You|(are) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise."
Allah will say,||"This|Day|will profit|the truthful|their truthfulness."|For them|(are) Gardens|flows|from|underneath it|the rivers|will abide|in it|forever."|Allah is pleased||with them|and they are pleased|with Him.|That|(is) the great success.|
To Allah (belongs)|the dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and what|(is) in them.|And He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
(All) the praises and thanks|(be) to Allah,|the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|and made|the darkness[es]|and the light.|Then|those who|disbelieved|in their Lord|equate others with Him.
He|(is) the One Who|created you|from|clay|then|He decreed|a term -|and a term|specified|with Him,|yet|you|doubt.
And He|(is) Allah|in|the heavens|and in|the earth.|He knows|your secret|and what you make public|and He knows|what|you earn.
And not|comes to them|[of]|any sign|from|(the) Signs|(of) their Lord|but|they are|from it|turning away.
Then indeed,|they denied|the truth|when|it came to them,|but soon|will come to them|news|(of) what|they used to|[at it]|mock.
Did not|they see|how many|We destroyed|before them||of generations|We had established them|in|the earth|what|We (have) not established||for you?|And We sent|(rain from) the sky|upon them|showering abundantly|and We made|the rivers|flow|underneath them.||Then We destroyed them|for their sins|and We raised||after them||other generations.|
And (even) if|We (had) sent down|to you|a written Scripture|in|a parchment|and they touched it|with their hands,|surely (would) have said|those who|disbelieved,|"This is not||but|clear magic."|
And they said,|"Why has not been|sent down|to him|an Angel?"|And if|We (had) sent down|an Angel,|surely (would) have been decided|the matter|then|no|respite would have been granted to them.
And if|We had made him|an Angel,|certainly We (would) have made him|a man,|and certainly We (would) have obscured|to them|what|they are obscuring.
And indeed|were mocked|Messengers||before you|but surrounded|those who|scoffed|of them|what|they used to|[at it]|mock.
Say,|"Travel|in|the earth|and|see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the rejecters."
Say,|"To whom (belongs)|what|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth?"|Say,|"To Allah."|He has decreed|upon|Himself|the Mercy.|Surely He will assemble you|on|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|(there is) no|doubt|about it.|Those who|have lost|themselves,|then they|(do) not|believe.
And for Him|(is) whatever|dwells|in|the night|and the day,|and He|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Say,|"Is it other than|Allah|I (should) take|(as) a protector,|Creator,|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|while (it is) He|Who feeds|and not|He is fed?"|Say,|"Indeed I|[I] am commanded|that|I be|(the) first|who|submits (to Allah)|and not|be|of|the polytheists."
Say,|"Indeed, I|[I] fear|if|I disobeyed|my Lord,|punishment|(of) a Mighty Day."|
Whoever|is averted|from it|that Day|then surely|He had Mercy on him.|And that|(is) the success|(the) clear.
And if|Allah touches you||with affliction|then no|remover|of it|except|Him.|And if|He touches you|with good,|then He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And He|(is) the Subjugator|over|His slaves.|And He|(is) the All-Wise,|the All-Aware.
Say,|"What|thing|(is) greatest|(as) a testimony?"|Say,|"Allah|(is) Witness|between me|and between you,|and has been revealed|to me|this|[the] Quran|that I may warn you|with it|and whoever|it reaches.|Do you truly|testify|that|with|Allah|(there are) gods|other?"|Say,|"I (do) not testify."||Say,|"Only|He|(is) One God,||and indeed, I am|free|of what|you associate (with Him).
Those (to) whom|We have given them|the Book|they recognize him|as|they recognize|their sons.|Those who|lost|themselves|then they|(do) not|believe.
And who|(is) more unjust|than (he) who|invents|against|Allah|a lie|or|rejects|His Signs?|Indeed,|not|will be successful|the wrongdoers.
And (the) Day|We will gather them|all,|then|We will say|to those who|associated others with Allah,|"Where (are)|your partners,|those whom|you used to|claim.
Then|not|will be|(for) them a plea|except|that|they say,|"By Allah,|our Lord,|not|we were|those who associated others (with Allah) ."
Look|how|they lied|against|themselves.|And lost|from them|what|they used to|invent.
And among them|(are those) who|listen|to you,|but We have placed|over|their hearts|coverings|lest|they understand it,|and in|their ears|deafness.|And if|they see|every|sign|they will not believe||in it.|Until,|when|they come to you|and argue with you|say|those who|disbelieved,|"This (is) not||but|(the) tales|(of) the former (people)."
And they|forbid (others)|from it|and they keep away|from it.|And not|they destroy|except|themselves|and not|they perceive.
And if|you (could) see|when|they are made to stand|by|the Fire|then they (will) say,|"Oh  Would that we|were sent back|and not|we would deny|(the) Signs|(of) our Lord|and we would be|among|the believers."
Nay,|became manifest|for them|what|they used to|conceal|before.||And if|they were sent back|certainly they (would) return|to what|they were forbidden|from it,|and indeed they|certainly are liars.
And they said,|"Not it (is)||except|our life|(of) the world|and not|we|(will be) resurrected.
And if|you (could) see|when|they will be made to stand|before|their Lord.|He (will) say,|"Is not|this|the truth?"|They will say,|"Yes,|by our Lord."|He (will) say,|"So taste|the punishment|because|you used to|disbelieve."
Indeed,|incurred loss|those who|denied|in (the) meeting|(with) Allah,|until|when|came to them|the Hour|suddenly|they said,|"Oh  Our regret|over|what|we neglected|concerning it,|while they|will bear|their burdens|on|their backs.|Unquestionably |Evil|(is) what|they bear.
And not|(is) the life|(of) the world|except|a play|and amusement;|but the home|(of) the Hereafter|(is) best|for those who|(are) God conscious.|Then, will you not reason?|
Indeed,|We know|that it|grieves you|what|they say.|And indeed, they|(do) not|deny you|but|the wrongdoers -|the Verses of Allah||they reject.
And surely|were rejected|Messengers||before you,|but they were patient|over|what|they were rejected|and they were harmed|until|came to them|Our help.|And no|one (can) alter|(the) words|(of) Allah,|and surely|has come to you|of (the) news||(of) the Messengers.
And if|is|difficult|for you|their aversion|then if|you are able|to|seek|a tunnel|in|the earth|or|a ladder|into|the sky|so that you bring to them|a Sign.|But if|Allah (had) willed||surely He (would) have gathered them|on|the guidance.|So (do) not|be|of|the ignorant.
Only|respond|those who|listen.|But the dead -|Allah will resurrect them,||then|to Him|they will be returned.
And they said,|"Why (is) not|sent down|to him|a Sign|from|his Lord?"|Say,|"Indeed|Allah|(is) Able|[on]|to|send down|a Sign,|but|most of them|(do) not|know."
And not|[of]|any animal|in|the earth|and not|a bird|(that) flies|with its wings -|but|(are) communities|like you.|We have not neglected||in|the Book|[of]|anything,|then|to|their Lord|they will be gathered.
And those who|rejected|Our Verses|(are) deaf|and dumb|in|the darkness[es].|Whoever|Allah wills -||He lets him go astray|and whoever|He wills -|He places him|on|(the) straight way.|
Say,|"Have you seen|if|(there) came to you|punishment|(of) Allah|or|(there) came to you|the Hour -|is it other than Allah||you call,|if|you are|truthful?"
"Nay,|Him Alone|you call|and He would remove|what|you call|upon Him|if|He wills,|and you will forget|what|you associate (with Him)."
And certainly|We sent (Messengers)|to|nations||before you,|then We seized them|with adversity|and hardship|so that they may|humble themselves.
Then why not|when|came to them|Our punishment,|they humbled themselves?|But|their hearts became hardened||and made fair-seeming|to them|the Shaitaan|what|they used to|do.
So when|they forgot|what|they were reminded|of [it],|We opened|on them|gates|(of) every|thing,|until|when|they rejoiced|in what|they were given,|We seized them|suddenly|and then|they|(were) dumbfounded.
So was cut off|(the) remnant|(of) the people|[those] who|did wrong.|And all praises and thanks|(be) to Allah|Lord|(of) the worlds.
Say,|"Have you seen|if|Allah took away||your hearing|and your sight|and sealed|[on]|your hearts,|who|(is the) god|other than|Allah|to bring it to you?||See|how|We explain|the Signs;|yet|they|turn away."
Say,|"Have you seen|if|comes to you|punishment|(of) Allah|suddenly|or|openly,|will|(any) be destroyed|except|the people -|the wrongdoers?
And not|We send|the Messengers|except|(as) bearer of glad tidings|and (as) warners.|So whoever|believed|and reformed,|then no|fear|upon them|and not|they|will grieve.
And those who|denied|[in] Our Verses|will touch them|the punishment|for what|they used to|defiantly disobey.
Say,|"I (do) not say||to you|(that) with me|(are the) treasures|(of) Allah|and not|(that) I know|the unseen|and not|I say|to you|that I (am)|an Angel.|I (do) not follow||except|what|is revealed|to me."|Say,|"Can|be equal|the blind|and the seeing one?"|Then will not|you give thought?
And warn|with it|those who|fear|that|they will be gathered|to|their Lord,|not|for them||other than Him|any protector|and not|any intercessor,|so that they may|(become) righteous.
And (do) not|send away|those who|call|their Lord|in the morning|and the evening|desiring|His Countenance.|Not|(is) on you|of|their account|[of]|anything,|and not|from|your account|on them|[of]|anything.|So were you to send them away,|then you would be|of|the wrongdoers.
And thus|We try|some of them|with others|that they say,|"Are these|(whom) Allah has favored||[upon them]|from|among us?"|Is not Allah||most knowing|of those who are grateful?
And when|come to you|those who|believe|in Our Verses|then say,|"Peace|(be) upon you.|Your Lord has prescribed||upon|Himself|the Mercy,|that he|who|among you does||evil|in ignorance|then|repents|after it||and reforms,|then, indeed He|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful."
And thus|We explain|the Verses,|so that becomes manifest|(the) way|(of) the criminals.
Say,|"Indeed I|[I] am forbidden|that|I worship|those whom|you call|besides Allah."|||Say,|"Not|I follow|your (vain) desires,|certainly|I would go astray|then,|and not|I (would be)|from|the guided-ones."
Say,|"Indeed, I (am)|on|clear proof|from|my Lord,|while you deny|[with] it.|Not|I have|what|you seek to hasten|of it.|Not|(is) the decision|except|for Allah.|He relates|the truth,|and He|(is the) best|(of) the Deciders."
Say,|"If|that|(were) with me|what|you seek to hasten|of it,|surely would have been decided|the matter|between me|and between you.|And Allah|(is) most knowing|of the wrongdoers.
And with Him|(are the) keys|(of) the unseen,|no (one)|knows them|except|Him.|And He knows|what|(is) in|the land|and in the sea.|And not|falls|any leaf||but|He knows it.|And not|a grain|in|the darkness[es]|(of) the earth|and not|moist|and not|dry|but|(is) in|a Record|Clear.
And He|(is) the One Who|takes your (soul)|by the night|and He knows|what|you committed|by the day.|Then|He raises you up|therein,|so that is fulfilled|(the) term|specified.|Then|to Him|will be your return|then|He will inform you|about what|you used to|do.
And He|(is) the Subjugator|over|His slaves,|and He sends|over you|guardians|until|when|comes|(to) anyone of you|the death|take him|Our messengers,|and they|(do) not|fail.
Then|they are returned|to|Allah|their Protector -|[the] True,|Unquestionably,|for Him|(is) the judgment?|And He|(is) swiftest|(in taking) account.
Say,|"Who|saves you|from|darkness[es]|(of) the land|and the sea,|you call Him|humbly|and secretly,|"If|He saves us|from|this,|surely we will be|from|the grateful ones.'"
Say,|"Allah|saves you|from it|and from|every|distress,|yet|you|associate partners (with Allah)."
Say,|"He|(is) All-Capable|[on]|to|send|upon you|punishment|from|above you|or|from|beneath|your feet|or|(to) confuse you|(into) sects|and make (you) taste -|some of you|violence|(of) others."|See|how|We explain|the Signs|so that they may|understand.
But denied|it -|your people|while it|(is) the truth.|Say,|"I am not|over you|a manager."
For every|news|(is) a fixed time,|and soon|you will know.
And when|you see|those who|engage (in vain talks)|about|Our Verses,|then turn away|from them|until|they engage|in|a talk|other than it.|And if|causes you to forget|the Shaitaan,|then (do) not|sit|after|the reminder|with|the people -|the wrongdoers.
And not|(is) on|those who|fear (Allah)|of|their account|[of]|anything;|but|(for) reminder,|so that they may|fear (Allah).
And leave|those who|take|their religion|(as) a play|and amusement|and deluded them|the life|(of) the world.|But remind|with it,|lest|is given up to destruction|a soul|for what|it (has) earned,|not|(is) for it|besides||Allah|any protector|and not|any intercessor.|And if|it offers ransom -|every|ransom,|not|will it be taken|from it.|Those|(are) ones who|are given to destruction|for what|they earned.|For them|(will be) a drink|of|boiling water|and a punishment|painful|because|they used to|disbelieve.
Say,|"Shall we call|besides||Allah|what|not|benefits us|and not|harms us,|and we turn back|on|our heels|after|[when]|Allah has guided us?||Like the one|whom the Shaitaan has enticed||in|the earth,|confused,|he has|companions|who call him|towards|the guidance,|"Come to us.'"|Say,|"Indeed,|(the) Guidance|(of) Allah,|it|(is) the Guidance,|and we have been commanded|that we submit|to (the) Lord|(of) the worlds
And to|establish|the prayer|and fear Him.|And He|(is) the One|to Him|you will be gathered."
And (it is) He|Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|in truth.|And (the) Day|He says,|"Be"|and it is,|His word|(is) the truth.|And for Him|(is) the Dominion|(on the) Day|will be blown|in|the trumpet.|(He is) All-Knower|(of) the unseen|and the seen.|And He|(is) the All-Wise,|the All-Aware.
And when|said|Ibrahim|to his father|Aazar,|"Do you take|idols|(as) gods?|Indeed, I|[I] see you|and your people|in|error|manifest."
And thus|We show(ed)|Ibrahim|the kingdom|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|so that he would be|among|the ones who are certain.
So when|covered|over him|the night,|he saw|a star.|He said,|"This|(is) my Lord."|But when|it set,|he said|"I (do) not like||the ones that set."
When|he saw|the moon|rising|he said,|"This|(is) my Lord."|But when|it set|he said,|"If|(does) not|guide me|my Lord,|I will surely be|among|the people|who went astray."
When|he saw|the sun|rising|he said,|"This (is)|my Lord,|this (is)|greater."|But when|it set,|he said,|"O my people |Indeed, I am|free|of what|you associate (with Allah)."
Indeed, I|[I] have turned|my face|to the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|(as) a true monotheist,|and not|I (am)|of|the polytheists.
And argued with him|his people.|He said,|"Do you argue with me|concerning|Allah|while certainly|He has guided me?|And I (do) not fear||what|you associate|with Him,|unless|[that]|my Lord wills||anything.|Encompasses|my Lord|every|thing|(in) knowledge.|Then will not|you take heed?
And how|could I fear|what|you associate (with Allah)|while not|you fear|that you|have associated|with Allah|what|He did not send down||for it|to you|any authority.|So which|(of) the two parties|has more right|to security|if|you|know?"
Those who|believed|and (did) not|mix|their belief|with wrong,|those,|for them,|(is) the security|and they|(are) rightly guided.
And this|(is) Our argument,|We gave it|(to) Ibrahim|against|his people.|We raise|(by) degrees|whom|We will.|Indeed,|your Lord|(is) All-Wise,|All-Knowing.
And We bestowed|to him|Ishaq|and Yaqub,|all|We guided.|And Nuh,|We guided|before;||and of|his descendents,|Dawood|and Sulaiman|and Ayub|and Yusuf|and Musa|and Harun.|And thus|We reward|the good-doers.
And Zakariya|and Yahya|and Isa|and Ilyas -|all were|of|the righteous.
And Ismail|and Al-Yasaa|and Yunus|and Lut,|and all|We preferred|over|the worlds.
And from|their fathers|and their descendents|and their brothers -|and We chose them|and We guided them|to|a straight path.|
That|(is the) Guidance|(of) Allah,|He guides|with it|whom|He wills|of|His slaves.|But if|they (had) associated partners (with Allah),|surely (would be) worthless|for them|what|they used to|do.
Those -|(are) ones whom|We gave them|the Book|and the judgment|and the Prophethood.|But if|disbelieve|in it|these,|then indeed,|We have entrusted|it|(to) a people|who are not|therein|disbelievers.
Those|(are) ones whom|Allah has guided,||so of their guidance|you follow.|Say,|"Not|I ask you|for it|any reward.|It (is) not||but|a reminder|for the worlds.
And (did) not|they appraise|Allah|(with) His true appraisal,||when|they said,|"Allah did not reveal|||on|a human being|[of]|anything."|Say,|"Who|revealed|the Book|which|brought|[it]|Musa|(as) a light|and guidance|for the people?|You make it|(into) parchments,|you disclose (some of) it|and you conceal|much (of it).|And you were taught|what|not|you knew||and not|your forefathers."|Say,|"Allah (revealed it)."|Then|leave them|in|their discourse -|playing.
And this|(is) a Book,|We have revealed it,|blessed,|confirming|which|(came) before it,||so that you may warn|(the) mother|(of) the cities|and who|(are) around it.|Those who|believe|in the Hereafter,|they believe|in it,|and they,|over|their prayers|(are) guarding.
And who|(is) more unjust|than (one) who|invents|about|Allah|a lie|or|said,|"It has been inspired|to me"|while not|it was inspired|to him|anything,|and (one) who|said,|"I will reveal|like|what|Allah has revealed."||And if|you (could) see|when|the wrongdoers|(are) in|agonies|(of) [the] death|while the Angels|(are) stretching out|their hands (saying),|"Discharge|your souls |Today|you will be recompensed|(with) humiliating punishment||because|you used to|say|against|Allah|other than|the truth|and you were|towards|His Verses|being arrogant.
And certainly|you have come to Us|alone|as|We created you|(the) first|time,|and you have left|whatever|We bestowed (on) you|behind|your backs.|And not|We see|with you|your intercessors|those whom|you claimed|that they (were)|in your (matters)|partners (with Allah).|Indeed,|have been severed (bonds)|between you|and is lost|from you|what|you used to|claim.
Indeed,|Allah|(is the) Cleaver|(of) the grain|and the date-seed.|He brings forth|the living|from|the dead|and brings forth|the dead|from|the living.|That|(is) Allah,|so how|are you deluded?
(He is the) Cleaver|(of) the daybreak|and He has made|the night|(for) rest|and the sun|and the moon|(for) reckoning.|That|(is the) ordaining|(of) the All-Mighty,|the All-Knowing.
And He|(is) the One Who|made|for you|the stars|that you may guide yourselves|with them|in|the darkness[es]|(of) the land|and the sea.|Certainly,|We have made clear|the Signs|for a people|(who) know.
And He|(is) the One Who|(has) produced you|from|a single soul,||so (there is) a place of dwelling|and a resting place.|Certainly,|We have made clear|the Signs|for a people|(who) understand.
And He|(is) the One Who|sends down|from|the sky|water,|then We bring forth|with it|vegetation|(of) every|thing.|Then We bring forth|from it|green plant,|We bring forth|from it|grain -|thick clustered.|And from|the date-palm,|from|its spathe|clusters of dates|hanging low.|And gardens|of|grapes|and the olives|and the pomegranates|resembling|and not|resembling.|Look|at|its fruit|when|it bears fruit|and its ripening.|Indeed,|in|that|(are) signs|for a people|(who) believe.
And they make|with Allah|partners -|jinn|though He has created them,|and they falsely attribute|to Him|sons|and daughters|without|knowledge.|Glorified is He|and Exalted|above what|they attribute.
Originator|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|How|can be|for Him|a son|while not|(there) is|for Him|a companion,|and He created|every|thing?|And He|(is) of every|thing|All-Knower.
That|(is) Allah|your Lord,|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|(the) Creator|(of) every|thing,|so worship Him.|And He|(is) on|every|thing|a Guardian.
(Can) not|grasp Him|the visions|but He|(can) grasp|(all) the vision,|and He (is)|the All-Subtle,|the All-Aware.
Verily,|has come to you|enlightenment|from|your Lord.|Then whoever|sees,|then (it is) for his soul,|and whoever|(is) blind|then (it is) against himself.|And I am not||over you|a guardian.
And thus|We explain|the Signs|that they (may) say,|"You have studied,"|and that We (may) make it clear|for a people|who know.
Follow,|what|has been inspired|to you|from|your Lord,|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|and turn away|from|the polytheists.
And if|Allah had willed,||not (they would have)|associated partners (with Him).|And not|We have made you|over them|a guardian,|and not|you|(are) over them|a manager.
And (do) not|insult|those whom3|they invoke|other than||Allah,|lest they insult|Allah|(in) enmity|without|knowledge.|Thus|We have made fair-seeming|to every|community|their deed.|Then|to|their Lord|(is) their return,|then He will inform them|about what|they used to|do.
And they swear|by Allah|strongest|(of) their oaths|that if|came to them|a sign,|they would surely believe|in it.|Say,|"Only|the signs|(are) with|Allah."|And what|will make you perceive|that [it]|when|it comes|not|they will believe.
And We will turn|their hearts|and their sights|(just) as|not|they believe|in it|(the) first|time.|And We will leave them|in|their transgression|wandering blindly.
And (even) if|[that] We (had)|[We] sent down|to them|the Angels|and spoken to them|the dead|and We gathered|before them|every|thing|face to face,|not|they were|to believe|unless|[that]|Allah wills.||But|most of them|(are) ignorant.
And thus|We made|for every|Prophet|an enemy -|devils|(from) the mankind|and the jinn,|inspiring|some of them|to|others|(with) decorative|[the] speech|(in) deception.|But if|your Lord had willed||they (would) not have done it,||so leave them|and what|they invent.
And so that incline|to it|hearts|(of) those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter,|and so that they may be pleased with it|and so that they may commit|what|they|(are) committing.
Then is (it) other than|Allah|I seek|(as) judge,|while He|(is) the One Who|has revealed|to you|the Book|explained in detail?|And those (to) whom|We gave them|the Book,|they know|that it|(is) sent down|from|your Lord|in truth,|so (do) not|be|among|the ones who doubt.
And (has been) fulfilled|(the) word|(of) your Lord|(in) truth|and justice.|No|one can change|His words,|and He|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Knower.
And if|you obey|most|of|(those) in|the earth|they will mislead you|from|(the) way|(of) Allah.|Not|they follow|except|[the] assumption,|and not|they (do)|except|guess.
Indeed,|your Lord,|He|knows best|who|strays|from|His way,|and He|(is) most knowing|of the guided-ones.
So eat|of what|(is) mentioned|(the) name|(of) Allah|on it,|if|you are|in His Verses -|believers.
And what|for you|that not|you eat|of what|has been mentioned|Allah's name||on it,|when indeed,|He (has) explained in detail|to you|what|He (has) forbidden|to you|except|what|you are compelled|to it.|And indeed,|many|surely lead astray|by their (vain) desires|without|knowledge.|Indeed,|your Lord,|He|(is) most knowing|of the transgressors.
Forsake|open|[the] sins|and the secret.|Indeed,|those who|earn|[the] sin|they will be recompensed|for what|they used to|commit.
And (do) not|eat|of that,|not|has been mentioned|Allah's name||on it,|and indeed, it (is)|grave disobedience.|And indeed,|the devils|inspire|to|their friends|so that they dispute with you,|and if|you obey them,|indeed, you|(would) be the polytheists.
Is (one) who|was|dead|and We gave him life|and We made|for him|light,|he walks|whereby|among|the people,|like (one) who|[similar to him]|(is) in|the darknesses,|not|he comes out|of it?|Thus|is made fair-seeming|to the disbelievers|what|they were|doing.
And thus|We placed|in|every|city|greatest|(of) its criminals,|so that they plot|therein.|And not|they plot|except|against themselves|and not|they perceive.
And when|comes to them|a Sign|they say,|"Never|we will believe|until|we are given|like|what|was given|(to the) Messengers|(of) Allah."|Allah|knows best|where|He places|His Message.|Will afflict|those who|committed crimes|a humiliation|from|Allah|and a punishment|severe|for what|they used to|plot.
So whoever|Allah wants||that|He guides him -|He expands|his breast|to Islam;|and whoever|He wants|that|He lets him go astray|He makes|his breast|tight|and constricted|as though|he (were) climbing|into|the sky.|Thus|Allah places||the filth|on|those who|(do) not|believe.
And this|(is the) way|(of) your Lord -|straight.|Certainly|We have detailed|the Verses|for a people|who take heed.
For them|(will be) home|(of) [the] peace|with|their Lord.|And He|(will be) their protecting friend|because|(of what) they used to|do.
And (the) Day|He will gather them|all,|(and will say), "O assembly|(of) [the] jinn |Certainly,|you have (misled) many|of|the mankind."|And will say their friends||among|the men,|"Our Lord|profited|some of us|by others,|and we have reached|our term|which|You appointed|for us."|He will say,|"The Fire|(is) your abode,|will abide forever|in it,|except|(for) what|Allah wills||Indeed,|your Lord|(is) All-Wise,|All-Knowing.
And thus|We make friends,|some (of)|the wrongdoers|(to) others|for what|they used to|earn.
O assembly|(of) [the] jinn|and [the] men |Did (there) not|come to you|Messengers|from (among) you,|relating|to you|My Verses|and warning you|(of the) meeting|(of) this day of yours?"||They will say,|"We bear witness|against|ourselves."|And deluded them|the life|(of) the world,|and they will bear witness|against|themselves|that they|were|disbelievers.
That (is because)|[that]|not|is|your Lord|one who destroys|the cities|for their wrongdoing|while their people|(are) unaware.
And for all|(will be) degrees|for what|they did.|And not|(is) your Lord|unaware|about what|they do.
And your Lord|(is) the Self-Sufficient|Owner of Mercy.||If|He wills|He can take you away|and grant succession|after you||(to) whom|He wills.|as|He raised you|from|the descendants|(of) other people.|
Indeed,|what|you are promised|(is) sure to come.|And you (can)not||escape (it).
Say,|"O my people |Work|on|your position.|Indeed, I am|a worker.|And soon|you will know|who|will have|for himself|(a good) home (in) the end.||Indeed [he],|(will) not|succeed|the wrongdoers."
And they assign|to Allah|out of what|He produced|of|the crops|and the cattle|a share|and they say,|"This|(is) for Allah,"|by their claim,|"And this|(is) for our partners."|But what|is|for their partners|(does) not|reach|[to]|Allah,|while what|is|for Allah|then it|reaches|[to]|their partners.|Evil|(is) what|they judge.
And likewise|made pleasing|to many|of|the polytheists -|(the) killing|(of) their children -|their partners -|so that they may ruin them|and that they make confusing|to them|their religion.|And if|Allah had willed||they (would) not have done so.||So leave them|and what|they invent.
And they say,|"These|cattle|and crops|(are) forbidden,|no (one)|can eat them|except|whom|we will,"|by their claim.|And cattle,|forbidden|(are) their backs|and cattle|not|they mention|(the) name (of) Allah||on it|(as) an invention|against Him.|He will recompense them|for what|they used to|invent.
And they say,|"What|(is) in|(the) wombs|(of) these|cattle|(is) exclusively|for our males|and forbidden|on|our spouses.|But if|is|(born) dead,|then they (all)|(are) partners in it."||He will recompense them|(for) their attribution.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Wise,|All-Knowing.
Certainly,|(are) lost|those who|killed|their children|(in) foolishness|without|knowledge|and forbid|what|Allah has provided them -||inventing (lies)|against|Allah.|Certainly,|they have gone astray|and not|they are|guided-ones.
And He|(is) the One Who|produced|gardens|trellised|and other than|trellised|and the date-palm|and the crops,|diverse|(are) its taste,|and the olives|and the pomegranates|similar|and other than|similar.|Eat|of|its fruit|when|it bears fruit,|and give|its due|(on the) day|(of) its harvest.|And (do) not|(be) extravagant.|Indeed, He|(does) not|love|the ones who are extravagant.
And of|the cattle|(are some for) burden|and (some for) meat.|Eat|of what|Allah (has) provided you,||and (do) not|follow|(the) footsteps|(of) Shaitaan.|Indeed, he|(is) to you|an enemy|open.
Eight|pairs -|of|the sheep,|two|and of|the goats|two.|Say,|"(Are) the two males|He has forbidden|or the two females||or what contains||[in it]|(the) wombs|(of) the two females?|Inform me|with knowledge,|if|you are|truthful."
And of|the camels|two|and of|the cows|two.|Say,|"(Is it) the two males|He (has) forbidden|or the two females||or what contains||[in it]|(the) wombs|(of) the two females?|Or|were you|witnesses|when|Allah enjoined you||with this?|Then who|(is) more unjust|than (one) who|invents|against|Allah|a lie|to mislead|the people|without|knowledge?|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|the wrongdoing people."|
Say,|"I (do) not find||in|what|has been revealed|to me|(anything) forbidden|to|an eater|who eats it|except|that|it be|dead|or|blood|poured forth|or|(the) flesh|(of) swine -|for indeed, it|(is) filth -|or|(it be) disobedience,|[is] dedicated|to other than|Allah|[on it].|But whoever|(is) compelled|not|desiring|and not|transgressing,|then indeed,|your Lord|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And to|those who|are Jews|We forbade|every|(animal) with claws,||and of|the cows|and the sheep|We forbade|to them|their fat|except|what|carried|their backs|or|the entrails|or|what|(is) joined|with the bone.|That|(is) their recompense|for their rebellion.|And indeed, We|[surely] are truthful.
But if|they deny you|then say,|"Your Lord|(is the) Possessor of Mercy||Vast,|but not|will be turned back|His wrath|from|the people|(who are) criminals."
Will say|those who|associate partners (with Allah),|"If|Allah had willed,||not|we (would) have associated partners (with Allah)|and not|our forefathers|and not|we (would) have forbidden|[of]|anything."|Likewise|denied|those who|(were) before them||until|they tasted|Our wrath.|Say,|"Is|with you|[of]|any knowledge|then produce it|for us?|Not|you follow|except|the assumption,|and not|you (do)|but|guess."
Say,|"With Allah|(is) the argument -|the conclusive.|And if|He (had) willed,|surely He (would) have guided you|all."
Say,|"Bring forward|your witnesses,|those who|testify|that|Allah|prohibited|this."|Then if|they testify|then (do) not|testify|with them.|And (do) not|follow|(the) desires|(of) those who|denied|Our Signs|and those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter,|while they|with their Lord|set up equals.
Say,|"Come,|I will recite|what|has prohibited|your Lord|to you.|That (do) not|associate|with Him|anything,|and with the parents|(be) good,|and (do) not|kill|your children|(out) of|poverty,|We|provide for you|and for them.|And (do) not|go near|[the] immoralities|what|(is) apparent|of them|and what|(is) concealed.|And (do) not|kill|the soul|which|Allah has forbidden||except|by (legal) right.|That|(He) has enjoined on you|with it,|so that you may|use reason."
And (do) not|go near|wealth|(of) the orphans|except|with that which||(is) best|until|he reaches|his maturity.|And give full|[the] measure|and the weight|with justice.|Not|We burden|any soul|except|(to) its capacity.|And when|you speak|then be just|even if|he is|a near relative.||And (the) Covenant|(of) Allah|fulfil.|That|(He) has enjoined on you|with it|so that you may|remember.
And that,|this|(is) My straight path,||so follow it.|And (do) not|follow|the (other) paths,|then they will separate you||from|His path.|That|(He) has enjoined on you|[with it]|so that you may|become righteous.
Moreover|We gave|Musa|the Book,|completing (Our Favor)|on|the one who|did good|and an explanation|of every|thing,|and a guidance|and mercy,|so that they may -|in (the) meeting|(with) their Lord|believe.
And this|(is) a Book|We have revealed it -|blessed,|so follow it|and fear (Allah)|so that you may|receive mercy.
Lest|you say,|"Only|was revealed|the Book|on|the two groups|before us,||and indeed|we were|about|their study|certainly unaware."
Or|you say,|"If|[that]|was revealed|to us|the Book|surely we (would) have been|better guided|than them.|So verily|has come to you|clear proofs|from|your Lord|and a Guidance|and a Mercy.|Then who|(is) more unjust|than (he) who|denies|[with] (the) Verses|(of) Allah,|and turns away|from them?|We will recompense|those who|turn away|from|Our Signs|(with) an evil|punishment|because|they used to|turn away.
Are|they waiting|except|that|comes to them|the Angels|or|comes|your Lord|or|comes|some (of)|(the) Signs|(of) your Lord?|(The) Day|(when) comes|some (of)|(the) Signs|(of) your Lord,|not|will benefit|a soul|its faith,|(if) it had not||believed|before||or|earned|through|its faith|any good.|Say,|"Wait.|Indeed, we|(are) those who wait."
Indeed,|those who|divide|their religion|and become|sects,|you are not|with them|in anything.||Only|their affair|(is) with|Allah,|then|He will inform them|of what|they used to|do.
Whoever|came|with a good deed,|then for him|(is) ten (times)|the like of it.|And whoever|came|with an evil deed|then not|he will be recompensed|except|the like of it,|and they|will not be wronged.|
Say,|"Indeed (as for) me,|has guided me|my Lord|to|a straight path -||a religion|right,|religion|(of) Ibrahim -|a true monotheist.|And not|he was|from|the polytheists.
Say,|"Indeed,|my prayer,|and my rites of sacrifice,|and my living,|and my dying|(are) for Allah,|Lord|(of) the worlds.
No|partners|for Him;|and with that|I have been commanded.|And I am|(the) first|(of) the ones who surrender (to Him).
Say,|"Is (it) other than|Allah|I (should) seek|(as) a Lord,|while He|(is) the Lord|(of) every|thing?"|And not|earns|every|soul|except|against itself,|and not|bears|any bearer of burden,|burden|(of) another.|Then|to|your Lord|(is) your return|then He will inform you|about what|you were|concerning it|differing.
And He|(is) the One Who|(has) made you|successors|(of) the earth|and raised|some of you|above|others|(in) ranks,|so that He may test you|in|what|He has given you.|Indeed,|your Lord|(is) swift|(in) the punishment,|and indeed, He (is)|[certainly], Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Alif Laam Meem Saad.
A Book|revealed|to you|so (let) not|be|in|your breast|any uneasiness|from it|that you warn|with it,|and a reminder|for the believers.
Follow|what|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord,|and (do) not|follow|besides Him||any allies.|Little|(is) what|you remember.
And how many|of|a city|We destroyed it,|and came to it|Our punishment|(at) night|or|(while) they|were sleeping at noon.
Then not|was|their plea|when|came to them|Our punishment|except|that|they said,|"Indeed, we|were|wrongdoers."
Then surely We will question|those (to) whom|were sent|to them (Messengers),|and surely We will question|the Messengers.
Then surely We will narrate|to them|with knowledge,|and not|We were|absent.
And the weighing|that day|(will be) the truth.|So whose -|(will be) heavy|his scales,|then those|[they]|(will be) the successful ones.
And (for) those|(will be) light|his scales,|so those|(will be) the ones who|lost,|themselves|because|they were|to Our Verses.|(doing) injustice
And certainly|We established you|in|the earth|and We made|for you|in it|livelihood.|Little|(is) what|you (are) grateful.
And certainly|We created you|then|We fashioned you.|Then|We said|to the Angels,|"Prostrate|to Adam,"|So they prostrated,|except|Iblees.|He was not||of|those who prostrated.
(Allah) said,|"What|prevented you|that not|you prostrate|when|I commanded you?"|(Shaitaan) said,|"I am|better|than him.|You created me|from|fire|and You created him|from|clay."
(Allah) said,|"Then go down|from it,|for not|it is|for you|that|you be arrogant|in it.|So get out;|indeed, you|(are) of|the disgraced ones."
(Shaitaan) said,|"Give me respite|till|(the) Day|they are raised up."
(Allah) said,|"Indeed, you|(are) of|the ones given respite."
(Shaitaan) said,|"Because|You have sent me astray,|surely I will sit|for them|(on) Your straight path.|
Then|surely, I will come to them|from|before them||and from|behind them|and from|their right|and from|their left,|and You will not find||most of them|grateful."
(Allah) said,|"Get out|of it|disgraced|and expelled.|Certainly, whoever|follows you|among them,|surely, I will fill|Hell|with you|all.
And O Adam |Dwell,|you|and your wife,|(in) the Garden,|and you both eat|from|wherever|you both wish,|but (do) not|approach [you both]|this|[the] tree|lest you both be|among|the wrongdoers."
Then whispered|to both of them|the Shaitaan|to make apparent|to both of them|what|was concealed|from both of them|of|their shame.|And he said,|"(Did) not|forbid you both|your Lord|from|this|[the] tree|except|that|you two become|Angels|or|you two become|of|the immortals."
And he swore (to) both of them,|"Indeed, I am|to both of you|among|the sincere advisers."
So he made both of them fall|by deception.|Then when|they both tasted|the tree,|became apparent|to both of them|their shame,|and they began|(to) fasten|over themselves|from|(the) leaves|(of) the Garden.|And called them both|their Lord,|"Did not|I forbid you both|from|this|[the] tree|and [I] say|to both of you,|that|[the] Shaitaan|to both of you|an open enemy?"|
Both of them said,|"Our Lord|we have wronged|ourselves,|and if|not|You forgive|[for] us|and have mercy (on) us,|surely, we will be|among|the losers."
(Allah) said,|"Get down|some of you|to some others|(as) enemy.|And for you|in|the earth|(is) a dwelling place|and livelihood|for|a time."
He said,|"In it|you will live|and in it|you will die|and from it|you will be brought forth."
O Children|(of) Adam |Verily|We have sent down|to you|clothing,|it covers|your shame|and (as) an adornment.|But the clothing|(of) [the] righteousness -|that|(is) best.|That|(is) from|(the) Signs of Allah||so that they may|remember.
O Children|(of) Adam |(Let) not|tempt you|[the] Shaitaan|as|he drove out|your parents|from|Paradise,|stripping|from both of them|their clothing|to show both of them|their shame.|Indeed, he|sees you -|he|and his tribe|from|where|not|you see them.|Indeed,|We have made|the devils|friends|of those who|(do) not|believe.
And when|they do|immorality|they say,|"We found|on it|our forefathers|and Allah|(has) ordered us|of it."|Say,|"Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|order|immorality.|Do you say|about|Allah|what|you (do) not know?"|
Say,|"My Lord has ordered||justice|and set|your faces|at|every|masjid|and invoke Him|(being) sincere|to Him|(in) the religion.|As|He originated you|(so) will you return."
A group|He guided|and a group|deserved -|[on] they|the astraying.|Indeed, they|take|the devils|(as) allies|besides||Allah|while they think|that they|(are the) guided-ones.
O Children|(of) Adam |Take|your adornment|at|every|masjid,|and eat|and drink|but (do) not|be extravagant.|Indeed, He|(does) not|love|the extravagant ones.
Say,|"Who|has forbidden|(the) adornment|(from) Allah|which|He has brought forth|for His slaves,|and the pure things|of|sustenance?"|Say,|"They|(are) for those who|believe|during|the life|(of) the world,|exclusively (for them)|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection.|Thus|We explain|the Signs|for (the) people|who know."
Say,|"Only|(had) forbidden|my Lord|the shameful deeds|what|(is) apparent|of it|and what|is concealed,|and the sin,|and the oppression|without|[the] right,|and that|you associate (others)|with Allah|what|not|He (has) sent down|of it|any authority,|and that|you say|about|Allah|what|you (do) not know.|
And for every|nation|(is a fixed) term.|So when|comes|their term,|(they can) not|seek to delay|an hour,|and not|seek to advance (it).
O Children|(of) Adam |If|comes to you|Messengers|from you|relating|to you|My Verses,|then whoever|fears Allah,|and reforms,|then no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
But those who|deny|Our Verses|and (are) arrogant|towards them|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|will abide forever.
Then who|(is) more unjust|than (one) who|invented|against|Allah|a lie|or|denies|His Verses?|Those -|will reach them|their portion|from|the Book,|until|when|comes to them|Our messengers (Angels)|(to) take them in death|they say,|"Where are|those (whom)|you used to|invoke|besides||Allah?"|They say,|"They strayed|from us,"|and they (will) testify|against|themselves|that they|were|disbelievers.
He (will) say,|"Enter|among|(the) nations|(who) passed away||before you||of|the jinn|and the men|in|the Fire."|Every time|entered|a nation|it cursed|its sister (nation)|until|when|they had overtaken one another|in it|all,|(will) say|(the) last of them|about the first of them,|"Our Lord,|these|misled us|so give them|double punishment||of|the Fire."|He (will) say,|"For each|(is) a double|[and] but|not|you know."
And (will) say|(the) first of them|to (the) last of them,|"Then not|is|for you|upon us|any|superiority,|so taste|the punishment|for what|you used to|earn."
Indeed,|those who|denied|Our Verses|and (were) arrogant|towards them,|(will) not|be opened|for them|(the) doors|(of) the heaven,|and not|they will enter|Paradise|until|passes|the camel|through|(the) eye|(of) the needle.|And thus|We recompense|the criminals.
For them|of|(the) Hell|(is) a bed|and over them||coverings.|And thus|We recompense|the wrongdoers.
But those who|believe|and do|[the] righteous deeds|not|We burden|any soul|except|(to) its capacity.|Those|(are the) companions|(of) Paradise,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
And We will remove|whatever|(is) in|their breasts|of|malice.|Flows|from|underneath them|the rivers.|And they will say,|"All the praise|(is) for Allah,|the One Who|guided us|to this,|and not|we were|to receive guidance|if not|[that]|Allah (had) guided us.||Certainly,|came|Messengers|(of) our Lord|with the truth."|And they will be addressed,|[that]|"This|(is) Paradise,|you have been made to inherit it|for what|you used to|do."
And will call out|(the) companions|(of) Paradise|(to the) companions|(of) the Fire|that,|"Indeed,|we found|what|our Lord had promised us||true.|So have|you found|what|your Lord promised||(to be) true?"|They will say,|"Yes."|Then will announce|an announcer|among them,|[that]|"(The) curse|(of) Allah|(is) on|the wrongdoers,
Those who|hinder|from|(the) way|(of) Allah|and seek in it|crookedness|while they (are)|concerning the Hereafter,|disbelievers."
And between them|(will be) a partition,|and on|the heights|(will be) men|recognizing|all|by their marks.|And they will call out|(to the) companions|(of) Paradise|that|"Peace|(be) upon you."|Not|they have entered it|but they|hope.
And when|are turned|their eyes|towards|(the) companions|(of) the Fire,|they (will) say,|"Our Lord |(Do) not|place us|with|the people -|the wrongdoers."
And (will) call out|(the) companions|(of) the heights|(to) men|whom they recognize|by their marks|saying,|"Not|(has) availed|[to] you|your gathering|and what|you were|arrogant (about)."
Are these|the ones whom|you had sworn|that Allah (will) not grant them|||Mercy?|"Enter|Paradise|(There will be) no|fear|upon you|and not|you|will grieve."
And (will) call out|(the) companions|(of) the Fire|(to the) companions|(of) Paradise|[that],|"Pour|upon us|[of]|(some) water|or|of what|Allah has provided you."||They (will) say,|"Indeed,|Allah|has forbidden both|to|the disbelievers,
Those who|took|their religion|(as) an amusement|and play|and deluded them|the life|(of) the world."|So today|We forget them|as|they forgot|(the) meeting|(of) this Day of theirs,||and [what]|(as) they used to|reject Our Verses.|
And certainly|We had brought (to) them|a Book|which We have explained|with|knowledge -|a guidance|and mercy|for a people|who believe.
Do|they wait|except|(for) its fulfillment|(The) Day|(will) come|its fulfillment,|will say|those who|had forgotten it|before,||"Verily|had come|(the) Messengers|(of) our Lord|with the truth,|so are (there)|for us|any|intercessors|so (that) they intercede|for us|or|we are sent back|so (that) we do (deeds)|other than|that which|we used to|do."|Verily,|they lost|themselves,|and strayed|from them|what|they used to|invent.
Indeed,|your Lord|(is) Allah|the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|in|six|epochs,|then|He ascended|on|the Throne.|He covers|the night|(with) the day|seeking it|rapidly|and the sun|and the moon|and the stars -|subjected|by His command.|Unquestionably|for Him|(is) the creation|and the command,|blessed|(is) Allah,|Lord|(of) the worlds.
Call upon|your Lord|humbly|and privately.|Indeed, He|(does) not|love|the transgressors.
And (do) not|cause corruption|in|the earth|after|its reformation.|And call Him|(in) fear|and hope.|Indeed,|(the) Mercy of Allah||(is) near|for|the good-doers.
And  He|(is) the One Who|sends|the winds|(as) glad tidings|before||His Mercy,|until,|when|they have carried|clouds -|heavy,|We drive them|to a dead land||then We send down|from it|the water|then We bring forth|from it|all (kinds) of||[the] fruits.|Thus|We will bring forth|the dead|so that you may|take heed.
And the land -|[the] pure,|comes forth|its vegetation|by (the) permission|(of) its Lord,|but which|is bad -|(does) not|come forth|except|(with) difficulty.|Thus|We explain|the Signs|for a people|who are grateful.
Certainly,|We sent|Nuh|to|his people|and he said,|"O my people |Worship|Allah,|not|for you|any|god|other than Him.|Indeed, I|[I] fear|for you|punishment|(of the) Day|Great."
Said|the chiefs|of|his people,|"Indeed, we|surely see you|in|clear error."|
He said,|"O my people |(There is) no|error in me,||but I am|a Messenger|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
I convey to you|the Messages|(of) my Lord|and [I] advise|[to] you,|and I know|from|Allah|what|you (do) not know.|
Do you wonder|that|has come to you|a reminder|from|your Lord|on|a man|among you,|that he may warn you|and that you may fear,|and so that you may|receive mercy."
But they denied him,|so We saved him|and those who|(were) with him|in|the ship.|And We drowned|those who|denied|Our Verses.|Indeed, they|were|a people|blind.
And to|Aad|(We sent) their brother|Hud.|He said,|"O my people |Worship|Allah,|not|for you|any|god|other than Him.|Then will not|you fear (Allah)?"
Said|the chiefs|(of) those who|disbelieved|from|his people,|"Indeed, we|surely, see you|in|foolishness|and indeed, we|[we] think you|(are) of|the liars."
He said,|"O my people |(There is) no|foolishness in me||but I am|a Messenger|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
I convey to you|Messages|(of) my Lord|and I am|to you|an adviser -|trustworthy.
Do|you wonder|that|has come to you|a reminder|from|your Lord|on|a man|among you|that he may warn you?|And remember|when|He made you|successors|after|(the) people|(of) Nuh,|and increased you|in|the stature|extensively.|So remember|(the) Bounties|(of) Allah|so that you may|succeed."
They said,|"Have you come to us|that we (should) worship|Allah|Alone|and we forsake|what|used to|worship|our forefathers?|Then bring us|of what|you promise us,|if|you are|of|the truthful."
He said,|"Verily|has fallen|upon you|from|your Lord|punishment|and anger.|Do you dispute with me|concerning|names|you have named them -|you|and your forefathers|Allah (has) not sent down|||for it|any|authority?|Then wait,|indeed, I am|with you|of|the ones who wait."
So We saved him|and those|with him|by Mercy|from Us.|And We cut off|the roots|(of) those who|denied|Our Signs,|and they were not||believers.
And to|Thamud|(We sent) their brother|Salih.|He said,|"O my people |Worship|Allah,|not|for you|any|god|other than Him.|Verily|has come to you|a clear proof|from|your Lord,|This|(is) a she-camel|(of) Allah|(as) a Sign for you.||So you leave her|(to) eat|on|(the) earth|(of) Allah,|and (do) not|touch her|with harm,|lest seizes you|a punishment|painful."
And remember|when|He made you|successors|after||Aad,|and settled you|in|the earth.|You take|from|its plains|palaces|and you carve out|the mountains|(as) homes.|So remember|(the) Bounties|(of) Allah|and (do) not|act wickedly|in|(the) earth|spreading corruption.
Said|the chiefs|(of) those who|were arrogant|among|his people|to those who|were oppressed -|[to] those who|believed|among them,|"Do you know|that|Salih|(is the) one sent|from|his Lord?"|They said,|"Indeed, we|in what|he has been sent|with [it]|(are) believers."
Said|those who|were arrogant,|"Indeed we,|in that which|you believe|in it|(are) disbelievers."
Then they hamstrung|the she-camel|and (were) insolent|towards (the) command||(of) their Lord|and they said,|"O Salih |Bring us|what|you promise us|if|you are|of|the Messengers."
So seized them|the earthquake,|then they became|in|their homes|fallen prone.
So he turned away|from them|and he said,|"O my people |Verily,|I have conveyed to you|(the) Message|(of) my Lord|and [I] advised|[to] you|but|not|you like|the advisers."
And Lut,|when|he said|to his people,|"Do you commit|(such) immorality|not|has preceded you|therein|any|one|of|the worlds?
Indeed, you|you approach|the men|lustfully||instead of|the women.|Nay,|you|(are) a people|(who) commit excesses."
And not|was|(the) answer|(of) his people|except|that|they said,|"Drive them out|of|your town.|Indeed, they|(are) people|who keep themselves pure."
So We saved him|and his family|except|his wife,|she was|of|those who stayed behind.
And We showered|upon them|a rain.|So see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the criminals.
And to|Madyan,|his brother|Shuaib.|He said,|"O my people |Worship|Allah,|not|for you|any|god|other than Him.|Verily,|has came to you|a clear proof|from|your Lord.|So give full|[the] measure|and the weight|and (do) not|deprive|[the] people|in their things|and (do) not|cause corruption|in|the earth|after|its reformation.|That|(is) better|for you|if|you are|believers.
And (do) not|sit|on every|path|threatening|and hindering|from|(the) way|(of) Allah|(those) who|believe|in Him,|and seeking (to make) it|crooked.|And remember|when|you were|few|and He increased you.|And see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the corrupters.
And if|(there) is|a group|among you|(who has) believed|in that which|I have been sent|with [it],|and a group|not|they believe,|then be patient|until|Allah judges||between us.|And He|(is the) Best|(of) [the] Judges."
Said|the chiefs|(of) those who|were arrogant|among|his people,|"We will surely drive you out|O Shuaib |And those who|(have) believed|with you|from|our city,|or|you must return|to|our religion."|He said,|"Even if|we are|(the) ones who hate (it)?
Verily,|we would have fabricated|against|Allah|a lie|if|we returned|in|your religion|after|[when]|Allah saved us||from it.|And not|it is|for us|that|we return|in it|except|that|wills|Allah -|our Lord.|Our Lord Encompasses||every|thing|(in) knowledge.|Upon|Allah|we put our trust.|Our Lord |Decide|between us|and between|our people|in truth|and You|(are the) Best|(of) those who Decide."
And said|the chiefs|(of) those who|disbelieved|among|his people,|"If|you follow|Shuaib,|indeed, you|then|(will be) certainly losers.
Then seized  them|the earthquake,|then they became|in|their home(s)|fallen prone.
Those who|denied|Shuaib|(became) as if|not|they (had) lived|therein.|Those who|denied|Shuaib,|they were||the losers.
So he turned away|from them|and said,|"O my people |Verily,|I (have) conveyed to you|(the) Messages|(of) my Lord|and advised|[to] you.|So how could|I grieve|for|a people|(who are) disbelievers?"
And not|We sent|in|a city|[of]|any Prophet|except|We seized|its people|with adversity|and hardship,|so that they may|(become) humble.
Then|We changed|(in) place|(of) the bad|the good,|until|they increased|and said,|"Verily,|(had) touched|our forefathers|the adversity|and the ease."|So We seized them|suddenly,|while they|(did) not|perceive .
And if|[that]|people|(of) the cities|(had) believed|and feared Allah|surely We (would have) opened|upon them|blessings|from|the heaven|and the earth|but|they denied.|So We seized them|for what|they used to|earn.
Then did feel secure|(the) people|(of) the cities|that|comes to them|Our punishment|(at) night|while they|(were) asleep?
Or felt secure|(the) people|(of) the cities|that|comes to them|Our punishment|(in) daylight|while they|(were) playing?
Then did they feel secure|(from the) plan|(of) Allah?|But not|feel secure|(from the) plan|(of) Allah|except|the people|(who are) the losers.
Would it not|guide|[for] those who|inherit|the land|after||its people|that|if|We willed,|We (could) afflict them|for their sins|and We put a seal|over|their hearts|so they|(do) not hear?|
These|(were) the cities -|We relate|to you|of|their news.|And certainly|came to them|their Messengers|with clear proofs,|but not|they were|to believe|in what|they (had) denied|before.||Thus|Allah put a seal||on|(the) hearts|(of) the disbelievers.
And not|We found|for most of them|[of]|(any) covenant.|But|We found|most of them|certainly, defiantly disobedient.
Then|We sent|after them||Musa|with Our Signs|to|Firaun|and his chiefs,|But they were unjust|to them.|So see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the corrupters.
And Musa said,||"O Firaun |Indeed, I am|a Messenger|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds
Obligated|on|that|not|I say|about|Allah|except|the truth.|Verily,|I (have) come to you|with a clear Sign|from|your Lord,|so send|with me|(the) Children|(of) Israel."
He said,|"If|you have|come|with a Sign,|then bring|it|if|you are|of|the truthful."
So he threw|his staff,|and suddenly|it|(was) a serpent,|manifest.
And he drew out|his hand|and suddenly|it|(was) white|for the observers.
Said|the chiefs|of|(the) people|(of) Firaun,|"Indeed,|this|(is) surely a magician -|learned.
He wants|to|drive you out|from|your land,|so what|(do) you instruct?"
They said,|"Postpone him|and his brother,|and send|in|the cities|gatherers.
They (will) bring to you|[with] every|learned magician."|
So the magicians came||(to) Firaun.|They said,|"Indeed,|for us|surely (will be) a reward|if|we are||the victors."
He said,|"Yes,|and indeed you|surely (will be) of|the ones who are near."
They said,|"O Musa |Whether|[that]|you throw|or|[that]|we will be||the ones to throw?"
He said,|"Throw."|Then when|they threw,|they bewitched|(the) eyes|(of) the people,|and terrified them|and came (up)|with a magic|great.
And We inspired|to|Musa|that,|"Throw|your staff,"|and suddenly|it|swallow(ed)|what|they (were) falsifying.
So was established|the truth,|and became futile|what|they used to|do.
So they were defeated|there|and returned|humiliated.
And fell down|the magicians|prostrate.
They said,|"We believe|in (the) Lord|(of) the worlds
Lord|(of) Musa|and Harun."
Said|Firaun,|"You believed|in him|before|[that]|I give permission|to you.|Indeed,|this|(is) surely a plot|you have plotted it|in|the city|so that you may drive out|from it|its people.|But soon|you will know.
I will surely cut off|your hands|and your feet|of|opposite (sides).|Then|I will surely crucify you|all."
They said,|"Indeed, we|to|our Lord|(will) return.
And not|you take revenge|from us|except|that|we believed|in (the) Signs|(of) our Lord|when|they came to us.|Our Lord |Pour|upon us|patience|and cause us to die|(as) Muslims."
And said|the chiefs|of|(the) people|(of) Firaun,|"Will you leave|Musa|and his people|so that they cause corruption|in|the earth|and forsake you|and your gods?"|He said,|"We will kill|their sons|and we will let live|their women,|and indeed, we|over them|(are) subjugators."
Musa said||to his people,|"Seek help|from Allah|and be patient.|Indeed,|the earth|(belongs) to Allah.|He causes to inherit it|whom|He wills|of|His servants.|And the end|(is) for the righteous."
They said,|"We have been harmed|before||[that]|you came to us|and after||[what]|you have come to us."|He said,|"Perhaps|your Lord|[that]|will destroy|your enemy|and make you successors|in|the earth,|then see|how|you will do."
And certainly,|We seized|(the) people|(of) Firaun|with years (of famine)|and a deficit|of|[the] fruits,|so that they may|receive admonition.
But when|came to them|the good|they said,|"This is for us."||And if|afflicts them|bad,|they ascribe evil omens|to Musa|and who|(were) with him.|Behold |Only|their evil omens|(are) with|Allah|but|most of them|(do) not|know.
And they said,|"Whatever|you bring us|therewith|of|(the) sign|so that you bewitch us|with it,|then not|we|(will be) in you|believers."
So We sent|on them|the flood|and the locusts|and the lice|and the frogs|and the blood|(as) signs|manifest,|but they showed arrogance|and they were|a criminal people.|
And when|fell|on them|the punishment,|they said,|"O Musa |Invoke|for us|your Lord|by what|He has promised|to you.|If|you remove|from us|the punishment|surely, we will believe|[for] you|and surely, we will send|with you|(the) Children|(of) Israel."
But when|We removed|from them|the punishment|till|a (fixed) term|(which) they|were to reach [it],|then,|they|broke (the word).
So We took retribution|from them|and We drowned them|in|the sea|because they|denied|Our Signs,|and they were|to them|heedless.
And We made inheritors|the people|those who|were|considered weak -|(the) eastern (parts)|(of) the land|and the western (parts) of it,|which|We blessed|[in it].|And was fulfilled|(the) word|(of) your Lord -|the best|for|(the) Children|(of) Israel|because|they were patient.|And We destroyed|what|used to|make|Firaun|and his people,|and what|they used to|erect.
And We led across|(the) Children of Israel||the sea.|Then they came|upon|a people|devoted|to|idols|of theirs.|They said,|"O Musa |Make|for us|a god|like what|they have|gods.|He said,|"Indeed, you|(are) a people|ignorant.
Indeed|these,|destroyed|(is) what|they|(are) in it|and vain|(is) what|they used to|do."
He said,|"Should other than|Allah|I seek for you|a god,|while He|has preferred you|over|the worlds?"
And when|We saved you|from|(the) people|(of) Firaun|who were afflicting you|(with) worst|(of) torment,|they were killing|your sons|and letting live|your women.|And in|that|(was) a trial|from|your Lord|great.
And We appointed|(for) Musa|thirty|nights|and We completed them|with ten (more),|so was completed|(the) set term|(of) his Lord|(of) forty|night(s).|And said|Musa|to his brother|Harun,|"Take my place|in|my people,|and do right|and (do) not|follow|(the) way|(of) the corrupters."
And when|Musa came||to Our appointed place|and spoke to him|his Lord,|he said,|"O my Lord |Show me|(that) I may look|at You."|He said,|"Never|you (can) see Me,|but|look|at|the mountain|[then] if|it remains|in its place|then you will see Me."||But when|revealed (His) Glory|his Lord|to the mountain,|He made it|crumbled to dust|and Musa fell down||unconscious.|And when|he recovered|he said,|"Glory be to You |I turn (in repentance)|to you,|and I am|(the) first|(of) the believers."
He said,|"O Musa |Indeed, I|have chosen you|over|the people|with My Messages|and with My words.|So take|what|I have given you|and be|among|the grateful."
And We ordained (laws)|for him|in|the tablets -|of|every|thing,|an instruction|and explanation|for every|thing,|"So take them|with firmness|and order|your people|[to] take|(the) best of it.|I will show you|(the) home|(of) the defiantly disobedient."
I will turn away|from|My Signs|those who|are arrogant|in|the earth|without|[the] right;|and if|they see|every|sign,|they will not believe||in it.|And if|they see|(the) way|(of) the righteousness,|they will not take it||(as) a way,|but if|they see|(the) way|(of) [the] error,|they will take it|(as) a way.|That|(is) because they|denied|Our Signs|and they were|of them|heedless.
And those who|denied|Our Signs|and (the) meeting|(of) the Hereafter -|worthless|(are) their deeds.|Will|they be recompensed|except|(for) what|they used to|do?
And took|(the) people|(of) Musa,|after him||from|their ornaments|an image (of) a calf||[for] it|(had) a lowing sound.|Did not|they see|that it|(could) not|speak to them|and not|guide them|(to) a way?|They took it (for worship)|and they were|wrongdoers.
And when|they were regretful|||and they saw|that they|(had) indeed|gone astray,|they said,|"If|Our Lord does not have Mercy on us|||and forgive|[for] us,|we will surely be|among|the losers."
And when|Musa returned||to|his people -|angry,|and grieved,|he said,|"Evil is what|you have done in my place|after me.||Were you impatient|(over the) matter|(of) your Lord?"|And he cast down|the tablets|and seized|by head,|his brother|dragging him|to himself.|He said,|"O son|(of) my mother |Indeed,|the people|considered me weak|and were about (to)|kill me.|So (let) not|rejoice|over me|the enemies,|and (do) not|place me|with|the wrongdoing people."|
He said,|"O my Lord |Forgive me||and my brother|and admit us|into|Your Mercy,|for You|(are) the Most Merciful|(of) the merciful."
Indeed,|those who|took|the calf,|will reach them|wrath|from|their Lord,|and humiliation|in|the life|(of) the world.|And thus|We recompense|the ones who invent (falsehood).
And those who|do|the evil deeds|then|repented|after that||and believed,|indeed,|your Lord|after that||(is) surely Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And when|was calmed|from|Musa|the anger,|he took (up)|the tablets|and in|their inscription|(was) guidance|and mercy|for those who|[they]|(are) fearful of their Lord.|
And chose|Musa|(from) his people|seventy|men|for Our appointment.|Then when|seized them|the earthquake|he said,|"O my Lord |If You (had) willed,||You (could) have destroyed them||before|and me.|Would You destroy us|for what|did|the foolish|among us?|Not|it (was)|but|Your trial,|You let go astray|by it|whom|You will|and You guide|whom|You will.|You|(are) our Protector,|so forgive|us|and have mercy upon us,|and You|(are) Best|(of) Forgivers.
And ordain|for us|in|this|[the] world,|good|and in|the Hereafter.|Indeed, we|we have turned|to You."|He said,|"My punishment -|I afflict|with it|whom|I will,|but My Mercy|encompasses|every|thing.|So I will ordain it|for those who|(are) righteous|and give|zakah|and those who|[they]|believe in Our Verses.|
Those who|follow|the Messenger,|the unlettered Prophet,||whom|they find him|written|with them|in|the Taurat|and the Injeel.|He commands them|to the right|and forbids them|from|the wrong,|and he makes lawful|for them|the pure things|and makes unlawful|for them|the impure things|and he relieves|from them|their burden|and the fetters|which|were|upon them.|So those who|believe|in him|and honor him,|and help him|and follow|the light|which|has been sent down|with him.|Those (are)|[they]|the successful ones."
Say,|"O mankind ||Indeed I am|(the) Messenger|(of) Allah|to you|all,|the One|for Whom|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|(There is) no|god|except|Him,|He gives life|and causes death.|So believe|in Allah|and His Messenger,|the unlettered [the] Prophet||the one who|believes|in Allah|and His Words,|and follow him|so that you may|(be) guided."
And among|(the) people|(of) Musa|(is) a community|(which) guides|with truth|and by it|establishes justice.
And We divided them|(into) twelve||tribes|(as) communities.|And We inspired|to|Musa,|when|asked him for water|his people,|[that]|"Strike|with your staff|the stone."|Then gushed forth|from it|twelve||springs.|Certainly,|knew|each|people|their drinking place.|And We shaded|[on] them|(with) the clouds|and We sent down|upon them,|the manna|and the quails.|"Eat|from|(the) good things|which|We have provided you."|And not|they wronged Us|but|they were|(to) themselves|doing wrong.
And when|it was said|to them,|"Live|(in) this|city|and eat|from it|wherever|you wish|and say,|"Repentance,'|and enter|the gate|prostrating,|We will forgive|for you|your sins.|We will increase (reward)|(of) the good-doers."
But changed|those who|wronged|among them|word|other than|(that) which|was said|to them.|So We sent|upon them|torment|from|the sky|because|they were|doing wrong.
And ask them|about|the town|which|was|situated|(by) the sea,|when|they transgressed|in|the (matter of) Sabbath,|when|came to them|their fish|(on the) day|(of) their Sabbath|visibly|and (on the) day|not|they had Sabbath|(they did) not|come to them.|Thus|We test them|because|they were|defiantly disobeying.
And when|said|a community|among them,|"Why|(do) you preach|a people,|(whom) Allah|(is going to) destroy them|or|punish them|(with) a punishment|severe?"|They said,|"To be absolved|before|your Lord|and that they may|become righteous."
So when|they forgot|what|they had been reminded|with [it],|We saved|those who|forbade|[from]|the evil,|and We seized|those who|wronged|with a punishment|wretched,|because|they were|defiantly disobeying.
So when|they exceeded all bounds|about|what|they were forbidden|from it,|We said|to them,|"Be|apes,|despised."
And when|declared|your Lord|that He would surely send|upon them|till|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|(those) who|would afflict them|(with) a grievous|[the] punishment.|Indeed,|your Lord|(is) surely swift|(in) the retribution,|but indeed, He|(is) surely Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And We divided them|in|the earth|(as) nations.|Among them|(are) the righteous|and among them|(are) other than|that.|And We tested them|with the good|and the bad,|so that they may|return.
Then succeeded|[after] them||successors|(who) inherited|the Book|taking|goods|(of) this|the lower (life)|and they say,|"It will be forgiven for us."||And if|comes to them|goods|similar to it|they will take it.|Was not|taken|on them|Covenant|(of) the Book|that|not|they will say|about|Allah|except|the truth|while they studied|what|(is) in it?|And the home|(of) the Hereafter|(is) better|for those who|fear Allah.|So will not|you use intellect?
And those who|hold fast|to the Book,|and establish|the prayer,|indeed, We|(will) not|[We] let go waste|(the) reward|(of) the reformers.
And when|We raised|the mountain|above them|as if it was|a canopy|and they thought|that it|(would) fall|upon them,|(We said), "Take|what|We have given you|with strength|and remember|what|(is) in it|so that you may|fear Allah."
And when|your Lord took||from|(the) Children|(of) Adam -|from|their loins -|their descendants|and made them testify|over|themselves,|"Am I not|your Lord?"|They said,|"Yes|we have testified."|Lest|you say|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|"Indeed,|we were|about|this|unaware."
Or|you say,|"Only|our forefathers associated partners (with Allah)||before (us)||and we are|descendants||after them.|So will You destroy us|for what|did|the falsifiers?"
And thus|We explain|the Verses|so that they may|return.
And recite|to them|(the) story|(of the) one whom|We gave [him]|Our Verses,|but he detached|[from] them,|so followed him|the Shaitaan|and he became|of|those gone astray.
And if|We willed|surely, We (could) have raised him|with these|[and] but he|adhered|to|the earth|and followed|his (vain) desires.|So his example|(is) like (the) example|(of) the dog,|if|you attack|[on] him,|he lolls out his tongue|or|if you leave him,|he lolls out his tongue.|That|(is the) example|(of) the people|who|denied|[in] Our Signs.|So relate|the story|so that they may|reflect.
Evil|(as) an example|(are) the people|those who|denied|Our Signs|and themselves|they used to|wrong.
Whoever|Allah guides||then he|(is) the guided one|while whoever|He lets go astray|then those|[they]|(are) the losers.
And certainly|We have created|for Hell|many|of|the jinn|and men.|For them|(are) hearts|(but) not|they understand|with them,|and for them|(are) eyes|(but) not|they see|with them,|and for them|(are) ears|(but) not|they hear|with them.|Those|(are) like cattle,|nay|they|(are) more astray.|Those -|they|(are) the heedless.
And for Allah|(are) the names -|the most beautiful,|so invoke Him|by them.|And leave|those who|deviate|concerning|His names.|They will be recompensed|for what|they used to|do.
And of (those) whom|We have created|(is) a nation,|who guides|with the truth|and thereby|they establish justice.
But those who|denied|Our Signs,|We will gradually lead them|from|where|not|they know.
And I will give respite|to them.|Indeed,|My plan|(is) firm.
Do not|they reflect?|Not in their companion||[of]|(is) any madness.|Not|he|(is) but|a clear warner.|
Do not|they look|in|(the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and what|Allah has created||of|(every)thing|and that|perhaps|[that]|has|verily|come near -|their term?|So in what|statement|after this|will they believe?
Whoever|Allah lets go astray||then (there is) no|guide|for him.|And He leaves them|in|their transgression|wandering blindly.
They ask you|about|the Hour,|when will be|its appointed time?|Say,|"Only|its knowledge|(is) with|my Lord,|no (one)|can reveal [it]|its time|except|Him.|It lays heavily|in|the heavens|and the earth.|Not|will it come to you|but|suddenly."|They ask you|as if you|(were) well informed|about it.|Say,|"Only|its knowledge|(is) with Allah,||but|most|(of) the people|(do) not|know."
Say,|"I have no power||for myself|(to) benefit|and no|(power to) harm,|except|what|Allah wills.||And if|I would|know|(of) the unseen|surely I could have multiplied|of|the good|and not|(could) have touched me|the evil.|I am not||except|a warner|and a bearer of good tidings|to a people|who believe."
He|(is) the One Who|created you|from|a single soul||and made|from it|its mate|that he might live|with her.|And when|he covers her,|she carries|a burden|light|and continues|with it.|But when|she grows heavy,|they both invoke Allah,||their Lord,|"If|You give us|a righteous (child),|surely we will be|among|the thankful."
But when|He gives them|a good, (child)|they make|for Him|partners|in what|He has given them.|But exalted|(is) Allah|above what|they associate (with Him).
Do they associate|what|(can)not|create|anything|and they|are created?
And not|they are able|to (give) them|any help|and not|they can help themselves.|
And if|you call them|to|the guidance,|they will not follow you.||(It is) same|for you|whether you call them|or|you|remain silent.
Indeed,|those whom|you call|besides Allah|||(are) slaves|like you.|So invoke them|and let them respond|to you,|if|you are|truthful.
Are for them|feet|(to) walk|with [it],|or|for them|hands|(to) hold|with [it],|or|for them|eyes|(to) see|with [it],|or|for them|ears|(to) hear|with [it]?|Say,|"Call|your partners,|then|scheme against me|and (do) not|give me respite."
Indeed,|my protector|(is) Allah|the One Who|revealed|the Book.|And He|protects|the righteous.
And those whom|you invoke|besides Him,||not|they are able|(to) help you|and not|they can help themselves.|
And if|you call them|to|the guidance|they do not hear.||And you see them|looking|at you|but they|(do) not see.|
Hold|(to) forgiveness|and enjoin|the good,|and turn away|from|the ignorant.
And if|an evil suggestion comes to you|from|[the] Shaitaan|[an evil suggestion],|then seek refuge|in Allah.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Indeed,|those who|fear (Allah)|when|touches them|an evil thought|from|the Shaitaan,|they remember (Allah)|and then|they|(are) those who see (aright).
But their brothers|they plunge them|in|the error,|then|not|they cease.
And when|not|you bring them|a Sign|they say,|"Why (have) not|you devised it?"|Say,|"Only|I follow|what|is revealed|to me|from|my Lord.|This (is)|enlightenment|from|your Lord|and guidance|and mercy|for a people|who believe."
And when|is recited|the Quran,|then listen|to it|and pay attention|so that you may|receive mercy.
And remember|your Lord|in|yourself|humbly|and (in) fear|and without|the loudness|of|[the] words,|in the mornings|and (in) the evenings.|And (do) not|be|among|the heedless.
Indeed,|those who|(are) near|your Lord,|they (do) not turn away in pride||from|His worship.|And they glorify Him|and to Him|they prostrate.
They ask you|about|the spoils of war.|Say,|"The spoils of war|(are) for Allah|and the Messenger.|So fear|Allah|and set right|that|(which is) between you|and obey Allah||and His Messenger,|if|you are|believers."
Only|the believers|(are) those who|when|Allah is mentioned||feel fear|their hearts,|and when|are recited|to them|His Verses,|they increase them|(in) faith,|and upon|their Lord|they put their trust.
Those who|establish|the prayer|and out of what|We have provided them|they spend.
Those -|they are|the believers|(in) truth.|For them|(are) ranks|with|their Lord|and forgiveness|and a provision|noble.
As|brought you out|your Lord|from your home||in truth,|while indeed,|a party|among|the believers|certainly disliked.
They dispute with you|concerning|the truth|after what|was made clear,|as if|they were driven|to|[the] death|while they|(were) looking.
And when|Allah promised you||one|(of) the two groups -|that it (would be)|for you -|and you wished|that|(one) other than|the armed||would be|for you.|But Allah intended||to justify||the truth|by His words,|and cut off|(the) roots|(of) the disbelievers
That He might justify|the truth|and prove false|the falsehood,|even if|disliked (it)|the criminals.
When|you were seeking help|(of) your Lord|and He answered|[to] you,|"Indeed, I am|going to reinforce you|with a thousand|of|the Angels|one after another."
And not|Allah made it||but|good tidings|and so that might be at rest|with it|your hearts.|And (there is) no|[the] victory|except|from||Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
When|He covered you|with [the] slumber,|a security|from Him,|and sent down|upon you|from|the sky|water,|so that He may purify you|with it,|and take away|from you|evil (suggestions)|(of) the Shaitaan.|And to strengthen|[on]|your hearts|and make firm|with it|your feet.
When|inspired|your Lord|to|the Angels,|"I am|with you,|so strengthen|those who|believed.|I will cast|in|(the) hearts|(of) those who|disbelieved -|the terror,|so strike|above|the necks|and strike|from them|every|fingertip[s]."
That|(is) because they|opposed|Allah|and His Messenger.|And whoever|opposes|Allah|and His Messenger,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) severe|in [the] penalty.
That -|"So taste it."|And that,|for the disbelievers|(is the) punishment|(of) the Fire.
O you who believe |||When|you meet|those who|disbelieve|advancing,|then (do) not|turn to them|the backs.
And whoever|turns to them|his back that day||except|(as) a strategy|of war|or|(to) join|to|a group,|certainly|(he has) incurred|wrath|of|Allah|and his abode|(is) Hell,|a wretched|destination.
And not|you kill them,|but|Allah|killed them.|And not|you threw|when|you threw,|but|Allah|threw|and that He may test|the believers|from Him|(with) a trial|good.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
That (is the case)|and that,|Allah (is)|one who makes weak|(the) plan|(of) the disbelievers.
If|you ask for victory|then certainly|has come to you|the victory.|And if|you desist,|then it (is)|good|for you,|but if|you return,|We will return (too).|And never|will avail|you|your forces|anything,|even if|(they are) numerous.|And that|Allah|(is) with|the believers.
O you who believe |||Obey|Allah|and His Messenger.|And (do) not|turn away|from him|while you|hear.
And (do) not|be|like those who|say,|"We heard,"|while they|do not|hear.
Indeed,|worst|(of) the living creatures|near|Allah|(are) the deaf,|the dumb -|those who|(do) not|use their intellect.
And if|Allah (had) known||in them|any good,|surely, He (would) have made them hear.|And if|He had made them hear,|surely they would have turned away,|while they|(were) averse.
O you who believe |||Respond|to Allah|and His Messenger|when|he calls you|to what|gives you life.|And know|that|Allah|comes|(in) between|a man|and his heart,|and that|to Him|you will be gathered.
And fear|a trial|not|which will afflict|those who|do wrong|among you|exclusively.|And know|that|Allah|(is) severe|(in) the penalty.
And remember|when|you|(were) few|(and) deemed weak|in|the earth|fearing|that|might do away with you|the men,|then He sheltered you,|and strengthened you|with His help,|and provided you|of|the good things|so that you may|(be) thankful.
O you who believe |||(Do) not|betray|Allah|and the Messenger,|or betray|your trusts|while you|know.
And know|that|your wealth|and your children|(are) a trial.|And that|Allah -|with Him|(is) a reward|great.
O you who believe |||If|you fear|Allah,|He will grant|you|a criterion|and will remove|from you|your evil deeds|and forgive|you.|And Allah|(is) the Possessor of Bounty,||the Great.
And when|plotted|against you|those who|disbelieved|that they restrain you|or|kill you|or|drive you out.|And they were planning|and Allah (too) was planning.||And Allah|is (the) Best|(of) the Planners.
And when|are recited|to them|Our Verses|they say,|"Verily|we have heard.|if|we wish|surely, we could say|like|this.|This is not||but|tales|(of) the former (people)."
And when|they said,|" O Allah |If|this is [it]|||the truth|from You||then (send) rain|upon us|(of) stones|from|the sky|or|bring (upon) us|a punishment|painful."
But not|is|(for) Allah|that He punishes them|while you|(are) among them,|and not|is|Allah|the One Who punishes them|while they|seek forgiveness.
But what|(is) for them|that not|(should) Allah punish them||while they|hinder (people)|from|Al-Masjid Al-Haraam,||while not|they are|its guardians?|Not (can be)|its guardians|except|the ones who fear Allah,|but|most of them|(do) not|know.
And not|was|their prayer|at|the House|except|whistling|and clapping.|So taste|the punishment|because|you used to|disbelieve.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve,|they spend|their wealth|to hinder (people)|from|(the) way|(of) Allah.|So they will spend it,|then|it will be|for them|a regret,|then|they will be overcome.|And those who|disbelieve,|to|Hell|they will be gathered.
That Allah may distinguish||the wicked|from|the good,|and place|the wicked|some of them|on|others|and heap them|all together,|and put them|in|Hell.|Those -|they|(are) the losers.
Say|to those who|disbelieve|if|they cease|will be forgiven|for them|what|[verily]|(is) past.|But if|they return|then verily|preceded|(the) practice|(of) the former (people).
And fight them|until|there is no||oppression|and is|the religion|all of it|for Allah.|But if|they ceased,|then indeed,|Allah|of what|they do|(is) All-Seer.
And if|they turn away|then know|that|Allah|(is) your Protector,|Excellent|(is) the Protector,|and Excellent|(is) the Helper.
And know|that what|you obtain (as) spoils of war|of|anything,|then that,|for Allah|(is) one fifth of it|and for the Messenger|and for the near relatives,||and the orphans|and the needy|and the wayfarer,||if|you|believe|in Allah,|and (in) what|We sent down|to|Our slave|(on the) day|(of) the criterion,|(the) day|(when) met|the two forces.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
When|you (were)|on the nearer side of the valley||and they|(were) on the farther side||and the caravan|(was) lower|than you.|And if|you (had) made an appointment|certainly you would have failed|in|the appointment.|But|that Allah might accomplish||a matter|(that) was|destined,|that (might be) destroyed|(those) who|(were to be) destroyed|on|a clear evidence|and (might) live|(those) who|(were to) live|on|a clear evidence.|And indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
When|Allah showed them to you||in|your dream|(as) few,|and if|He had shown them to you|(as) many|surely you would have lost courage|and surely you would have disputed|in|the matter,|but|Allah|saved (you).|Indeed, He|(is) All-Knower|of what is in the breasts.|
And when|He showed them to you,|when|you met -|in|your eyes|(as) few|and He made you (appear) as few|in|their eyes|that Allah might accomplish||a matter|(that) was|(already) destined.|And to|Allah|return|(all) the matters.
O you who believe |||When|you meet|a force,|then be firm|and remember|Allah|much,|so that you may|(be) successful.
And obey|Allah|and His Messenger,|and (do) not|dispute|lest you lose courage|and (would) depart|your strength,|and be patient.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) with|the patient ones.
And (do) not|be|like those who|came forth|from|their homes|boastfully|and showing off|(to) the people,|and hinder (them)|from|(the) way|(of) Allah.|And Allah|of what|they do|(is) All-Encompassing.
And when|made fair-seeming|to them|the Shaitaan|their deeds|and he said,|"No (one)|(can) overcome|[to] you|today|from|the people|and indeed, I am|a neighbor|for you."|But when|came in sight|the two forces|he turned away|on|his heels|and said,|"Indeed, I am|free|of you.|Indeed, I|see|what|you (do) not see,||indeed, I|[I] fear|Allah.|And Allah|(is) severe|(in) the penalty."
When|said|the hypocrites|and those who -|in|their hearts|(was) a disease,|"(Had) deluded|these (people)|their religion."|But whoever|puts (his) trust|in|Allah|then indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise."
And if|you (could) see|when|take away souls|(of) those who|disbelieve|the Angels,|striking|their faces|and their backs|"Taste|(the) punishment|(of) the Blazing Fire."
That|(is) for what|sent forth|your hands.|And indeed,|Allah|(is) not|unjust|to His slaves.
Like (the) way|(of) people of Firaun||and those who|(were) before them.||They disbelieved|in (the) Signs|(of) Allah,|so Allah seized them||for their sins.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Strong|(and) severe|(in) the penalty.
That|(is) because|Allah is not|||One Who changes|a favor|which He had bestowed|on|a people|until|they change|what|(is) in themselves.|And indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearing,|All-Knowing.
Like (the) way|(of) people of Firaun||and those who|(were) before them.||They denied|(the) Signs|(of) their Lord,|so We destroyed them|for their sins|and We drowned|(the) people of Firaun||and (they) all|were|wrongdoers.
Indeed,|(the) worst|(of) the living creatures|near|Allah|(are) those who|disbelieve,|and they|(will) not|believe.
Those who -|you made a covenant with them||then|they break|their covenant|[in] every||time,|and they|(do) not|fear (Allah).
So if|you gain dominance over them|in|the war,|disperse|by them|(those) who|(are) behind them,|so that they may|take heed.
And if|you fear|from|a people|betrayal|throw back|to them|on|equal (terms).|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|the traitors.
And (let) not|think|those who|disbelieve|they can outstrip.|Indeed, they|(can) not|escape.
And prepare|for them|whatever|you able (to)|of|force|and of|cavalry||(to) terrify|therewith|(the) enemy of Allah,||and your enemy|and others|besides them,||you (do) not know them||(but) Allah|knows them.|And whatever|you spend|from|(any) thing|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|it will be fully repaid|to you,|and you|(will) not|be wronged.
And if|they incline|to peace,|then you (also) incline|to it,|and put (your) trust|in|Allah.|Indeed,|He|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Knower.
But if|they intend|to|deceive you,|then indeed,|Allah is sufficient for you.||He|(is) the One Who|supported you|with His help|and with the believers
And He (has) put affection|between|their hearts.|If|you (had) spent|whatever|(is) in|the earth|all|you could not (have) put affection||between|their hearts,|but|Allah|(has) put affection|between them.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
O Prophet ||Allah (is) sufficient for you||and whoever|follows you|of|the believers.
O Prophet ||Urge|the believers|to|[the] fight.|If|(there) are|among you|twenty|steadfast|they will overcome|two hundred.|And if|(there) are|among you|a hundred,|they will overcome|a thousand|of|those who|disbelieve,|because they|(are) a people|(who do) not|understand.
Now|Allah has lightened||for you,|and He knows|that|(there) is weakness in you.||So if|(there) are|among you|a hundred|steadfast,|they will overcome|two hundred.|And if|(there) are|among you|a thousand,|they will overcome|two thousand|with Allah's permission.||And Allah|(is) with|the steadfast.
Not is||for a Prophet|that|(there) should be|for him|prisoners of war|until|he has battled strenuously|in|the land.|You desire|(the) commodities|(of) the world,|but Allah|desires|(for you) the Hereafter.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Had not|an ordainment|from Allah||preceded,|surely (would) have touched you|for what|you took -|a punishment|great.
So eat|from what|you got as war booty -|lawful|(and) good,|and fear|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
O Prophet ||Say|to whoever|(is) in|your hands|of|the captives,|"If|Allah knows||in|your hearts|any good,|He will give you|better|than what|was taken|from you,|and He will forgive|you.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful."
But if|they intend|(to) betray you|certainly|they have betrayed|Allah|before.||So He gave (you) power|over them.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and emigrated|and strove hard|with their wealth|and their lives|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and those who|gave shelter|and helped|those -|some of them|(are) allies|(of) another.|But those who|believed|and (did) not|emigrate,|(it is) not|for you||their protection||(in) anything,|until|they emigrate.|And if|they seek your help|in|the religion,|then upon you|(is to) help them|except|against|a people|between you|and between them|(is) a treaty.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
And those who|disbelieve,|some of them|(are) allies|(to) another.|If not|you do it,|(there) will be|oppression|in|the earth|and corruption|great.
And those who|believed|and emigrated|and strove hard|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and those who|gave shelter|and helped,|those -|they (are)|the believers|(in) truth.|For them|(is) forgiveness|and a provision|noble.
And those who|believed|afterwards,||and emigrated|and strove hard|with you,|then those|(are) of you.|But those of blood relationship,||some of them|(are) nearer|to another|in|(the) Book|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
Freedom from obligations|from|Allah|and His Messenger|to|those (with) whom|you made a treaty|from|the polytheists.
So move about|in|the land|(during) four|months|but know|that you|(can) not|escape|Allah|and that|Allah|(is) the One Who (will) disgrace|the disbelievers.
And an announcement|from Allah||and His Messenger|to|the people|(on the) day|(of) the greater Pilgrimage||that|Allah|(is) free from obligations|[of]|(to) the polytheists,|and (so is) His Messenger.|So if|you repent,|then, it is|best|for you.|But if|you turn away|then know|that you|(can) not|escape|Allah.|And give glad tidings|(to) those who|disbelieve|of a punishment|painful.
Except|those (with) whom|you have a treaty|among|the polytheists,|then|not|they have failed you|(in any) thing|and not|they have supported|against you|anyone,|so fulfil|to them|their treaty|till|their term.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|the righteous.
Then when|have passed|the sacred months,||then kill|the polytheists|wherever|you find them|and seize them|and besiege them|and sit (in wait)|for them|(at) every|place of ambush.|But if|they repent|and establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah|then leave|their way.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And if|anyone|of|the polytheists|seek your protection|then grant him protection|until|he hears|(the) Words of Allah.||Then|escort him|(to) his place of safety.|That|(is) because they|(are) a people|(who) do not know.|
How|can (there) be|for the polytheists|a covenant|with|Allah|and with|His Messenger,|except|those (with) whom|you made a treaty|near|Al-Masjid Al-Haraam?||So long as|they are upright|to you|then you be upright|to them.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|the righteous.
How|while, if|they gain dominance|over you|they do not regard (the ties)||with you|(of) kinship|and not|covenant of protection?|They satisfy you|with their mouths|but refuse,|their hearts|and most of them|(are) defiantly disobedient.
They exchange|[with] the Verses of Allah||(for) a little price,||and they hinder (people)|from|His way.|Indeed,|evil|(is) what|they used to|do.
Not|they respect (the ties)|towards|a believer|(of) kinship|and not|covenant of protection.|And those|[they]|(are) the transgressors.
But if|they repent|and establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah,|then (they are) your brothers|in|[the] religion.|And We explain in detail|the Verses|for a people|(who) know.
And if|they break|their oaths||after|their treaty|and defame|[in]|your religion,|then fight|the leaders|(of) [the] disbelief,|indeed, they -|no|oaths|for them,|so that they may|cease.
Will not|you fight|a people|who broke|their oaths|and determined|to drive out|the Messenger|and they|began (to attack) you|first|time?|Do you fear them?|But Allah|(has) more right|that|you should fear Him,|if|you are|believers.
Fight them -|Allah will punish them||by your hands|and disgrace them|and give you victory|over them,|and will heal|(the) breasts|(of) a people|(who are) believers.
And remove|(the) anger|(of) their hearts.|And  Allah accepts repentance||of|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
Or|(do) you think|that|you would be left|while not|Allah made evident||those who|strive|among you,|and not|take|besides Allah|||and not|His Messenger|and not|the believers|(as) intimates?|And Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do.
(It) is not||for the polytheists|that|they maintain|(the) masajid of Allah||(while) witnessing|against|themselves|[with] disbelief.|(For) those,|worthless|(are) their deeds,|and in|the Fire|they|(will) abide forever.
Only|will maintain|(the) masajid of Allah||(the one) who|believes|in Allah|and the Day|the Last,|and establishes|the prayer|and gives|the zakah|and not|fear|except|Allah.|Then perhaps|those,|[that]|they are|of|the guided ones.
Do you make|the providing of water|(to) the pilgrims|and (the) maintenance|(of) Al-Masjid Al-Haraam||like (the one) who|believes|in Allah|and the Day|the Last,|and strives|in|(the) way|(of) Allah?|They are not equal||near|Allah.|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people -|the wrongdoers.
Those who|believed|and emigrated|and strove|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|with their wealth|and their lives|(are) greater|(in) rank|near|Allah.|And those -|they|(are) the successful.
Their Lord gives them glad tidings||of Mercy|from Him|and Pleasure,|and Gardens|for them -|in it|(is) bliss|enduring.
(They will) abide|in it|forever.|Indeed,|Allah -|with Him|(is) a reward|great.
O you|who|believe |(Do) not|take|your fathers|and your brothers|(as) allies|if|they prefer|[the] disbelief|over|[the] belief.|And whoever|takes them as allies|among you,|then those|[they]|(are) the wrongdoers.
Say,|"If|are|your fathers,|and your sons,|and your brothers,|and your spouses,|and your relatives,|and wealth|that you have acquired|and the commerce,|you fear|a decline (in) it|and the dwellings|you delight (in) it|(are) more beloved|to you|than|Allah,|and His Messenger|and striving|in|His way,|then wait|until|Allah brings||His Command.|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people -|the defiantly disobedient."
Verily,|Allah helped you||in|many regions,||and (on the) day|(of) Hunain,|when|pleased you|your multitude,|but not|availed|you|anything|and (was) straitened|for you|the earth|(in spite) of its vastness,||then|you turned back,|fleeing.
Then|Allah sent down||His tranquility|on|His Messenger,|and on|the believers|and sent down|forces,|which you did not see||and He punished|those who|disbelieved.|And that|(is) the recompense|(of) the disbelievers.
Then|Allah accepts repentance||after||that|for|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
O you who believe |||Indeed,|the polytheists|(are) unclean,|so let them not come near||Al-Masjid Al-Haraam||after|this, their (final) year.||And if|you fear|poverty,|then soon|Allah will enrich you||from|His Bounty,|if|He wills.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
Fight|those who|(do) not|believe|in Allah|and not|in the Day|the Last,|and not|they make unlawful|what|Allah has made unlawful||and His Messenger,|and not|they acknowledge|(the) religion|(of) the truth,|from|those who|were given|the Scripture,|until|they pay|the jizyah|willingly,||while they|(are) subdued.
And said|the Jews,|"Uzair|(is) son|(of) Allah."|And said|the Christians,|"Messiah|(is) son|(of) Allah."|That|(is) their saying|with their mouths,|they imitate|the saying|(of) those who|disbelieved|before.||(May) Allah destroy them.||How|deluded are they
They have taken|their rabbis|and their monks|(as) Lords||besides|Allah|and the Messiah,|son|(of) Maryam.|And not|they were commanded|except|that they worship|One God.||(There) is no|god|except|Him.|Glory be to Him|from what|they associate (with Him).
They want|to|extinguish|Allah's light||with their mouths,|but Allah refuses||except|to|perfect|His Light|even if|the disbelievers dislike (it).|
He|(is) the One Who|has sent|His Messenger|with the guidance|and the religion|(of) [the] truth,|to manifest it|over|all religions.||Even if|dislike (it)|the polytheists.
O you who believe |||Indeed,|many|of|the rabbis|and the monks|surely eat|(the) wealth|(of) the people|in falsehood,|and hinder|from|(the) way|(of) Allah.|And those who|hoard|the gold|and the silver,|and (do) not|spend it|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|[so] give them tidings|of a punishment|painful.
(The) Day|it will be heated [on it]||in|the Fire|(of) Hell,|and will be branded|with it|their foreheads|and their flanks|and their backs,|"This|(is) what|you hoarded|for yourselves,|so taste|what|you used to|hoard."
Indeed,|(the) number|(of) the months|with|Allah|(is) twelve||months|in|(the) ordinance|(of) Allah|(from the) Day|He created|the heavens|and the earth;|of them,|four|(are) sacred.|That|(is) the religion|the upright,|so (do) not|wrong|therein|yourselves.|And fight|the polytheists|all together,|as|they fight you|all together.|And know|that|Allah|(is) with|the righteous.
Indeed,|the postponing|(is) an increase|in|the disbelief,|are led astray|by it|those who|disbelieve.|They make it lawful|one year|and make it unlawful|(another) year,|to adjust|the number|which|Allah has made unlawful||and making lawful|what|Allah has made unlawful.||Is made fair-seeming|to them|(the) evil|(of) their deeds.|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people -|the disbelievers.
O you who believe |||What|(is the matter) with you|when|it is said|to you|go forth|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|you cling heavily|to|the earth?|Are you pleased|with the life|(of) the world|(rather) than|the Hereafter?|But what|(is the) enjoyment|(of) the life|(of) the world|in (comparison to)|the hereafter|except|a little.
If not|you go forth,|He will punish you|(with) a painful punishment,||and will replace you|(with) a people|other than you,|and not|you can harm Him|(in) anything.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
If not|you help him,|certainly,|Allah helped him,||when|drove him out|those who|disbelieved,|the second|(of) the two,|when|they both|(were) in|the cave,|when|he said|to his companion,|"(Do) not|grieve,|indeed,|Allah|(is) with us."|Then Allah sent down||His tranquility|upon him,|and supported him|with forces|which you did not see,||and made|(the) word|(of) those who|disbelieved|the lowest,|while (the) Word|(of) Allah|it (is)|the highest.|And Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Go forth,|light|or heavy|and strive|with your wealth|and your lives|in|(the) way|(of) Allah.|That|(is) better|for you,|if|you|know.
If|it had been|a gain|near|and a journey|easy,|surely they (would) have followed you|but|was long|for them|the distance.|And they will swear|by Allah,|"If|we were able,|certainly we (would) have come forth|with you."|They destroy|their own selves|and Allah|knows|(that) indeed, they|(are) surely liars.
(May) Allah forgive||you |Why (did)|you grant leave|to them|until|(became) evident|to you|those who|were truthful,|and you knew|the liars?
(Would) not ask your permission||those who|believe|in Allah|and the Day|the Last|that|they strive|with their wealth|and their lives.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower|of the righteous.
Only|ask your leave|those who|(do) not|believe|in Allah|and the Day|the Last,|and (are in) doubts|their hearts,|so they|in|their doubts|they waver.
And if|they had wished|(to) go forth,|surely they (would) have prepared|for it|(some) preparation.|But|Allah disliked||their being sent,|so He made them lag behind|and it was said,|"Sit|with|those who sit."
If|they (had) gone forth|with you,|not|they (would) have increased you|except|(in) confusion|and would have been active|in your midst|seeking (for) you|dissension.|And among you (are some)|who would have listened|to them.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower,|of the wrongdoers.
Verily,|they had sought|dissension|before||and had upset|for you|the matters|until|came|the truth|and became manifest|(the) Order of Allah,||while they|disliked (it).
And among them|(is he) who|says,|"Grant me leave||and (do) not|put me to trial."|Surely,|in|the trial|they have fallen.|And indeed,|Hell|(will) surely surround|the disbelievers.
If|befalls you|good,|it distresses them,|but if|befalls you|a calamity|they say,|"Verily,|we took|our matter|before."||And they turn away|while they|(are) rejoicing.
Say,|"Never|will befall us|except|what|Allah has decreed||for us,|He|(is) our Protector."|And on|Allah|[so] let the believers put (their) trust.|
Say,|"Do|you await|for us|except|one|(of) the two best (things)|while we|[we] await|for you|that|Allah will afflict you||with a punishment|from|[near] Him,|or|by our hands?|So wait,|indeed, we|with you|(are) waiting."
Say,|"Spend|willingly|or|unwillingly;|never|will be accepted|from you.|Indeed, you|[you] are|a people|defiantly disobedient."
And not|prevents them|that|is accepted|from them|their contributions|except|that they|disbelieve|in Allah|and in His Messenger,|and not|they come|(to) the prayer|except|while they|(are) lazy,|and not|they spend|except|while they|(are) unwilling.
So (let) not|impress you|their wealth|and not|their children.|Only|Allah intends||to punish them|with it|in|the life|(of) the world,|and should depart|their souls|while they|(are) disbelievers.
And they swear|by Allah|indeed, they|surely (are) of you,|while not|they|(are) of you,|but they|(are) a people|(who) are afraid.
If|they could find|a refuge|or|caves|or|a place to enter,|surely, they would turn|to it,|and they|run wild.
And among them|(is he) who|criticizes you|concerning|the charities.|Then if|they are given|from it,|they are pleased;|but if|not|they are given|from it,|then|they|(are) enraged.
And if|[that] they|(were) satisfied|(with) what|Allah gave them||and His Messenger,|and said,|"Sufficient for us|(is) Allah,|Allah will give us||of|His Bounty|and His Messenger.|Indeed, we|to|Allah|turn our hopes."
Only|the charities|(are) for the poor,|and the needy|and those who collect|them,|and the ones inclined|their hearts,|and in|the (freeing of) the necks,|and for those in debt|and in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|and the wayfarer -||an obligation|from|Allah.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And among them|(are) those who|hurt|the Prophet|and they say,|"He is|(all) ear."|Say,|"An ear|(of) goodness|for you,|he believes|in Allah,|and believes|the believers,|and (is) a mercy|to those who|believe|among you."|And those who|hurt|(the) Messenger|(of) Allah,|for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
They swear|by Allah|to you|to please you.|And Allah|and His Messenger|(have) more right|that|they should please Him,|if|they are|believers.
Do not|they know|that he|who|opposes|Allah|and His Messenger,|[then] that,|for him|(is the) Fire|(of) Hell,|(will) abide forever|in it?|That|(is) the disgrace|the great.
Fear|the hypocrites|lest|be revealed|about them|a Surah,|informing them|of what|(is) in|their hearts.|Say,|"Mock,|indeed,|Allah|(will) bring forth|what|you fear."
And if|you ask them,|surely they will say,|"Only|we were|conversing|and playing."|Say,|"Is it Allah|and His Verses|and His Messenger|(that) you were|mocking?"
(Do) not|make excuse;|verily,|you have disbelieved|after|your belief.|If|We pardon|[on]|a party|of you|We will punish|a party,|because they|were|criminals.
The hypocrite men|and the hypocrite women,|some of them|(are) of|others.|They enjoin|the wrong|and forbid|what|(is) the right,|and they close|their hands.|They forget|Allah,|so He has forgotten them.|Indeed,|the hypocrites,|they (are)|the defiantly disobedient.
Allah has promised||the hypocrite men,|and the hypocrite women|and the disbelievers,|Fire|(of the) Hell,|they (will) abide forever|in it.|It (is)|sufficient for them.|And Allah has cursed them,||and for them|(is) a punishment|enduring.
Like those|before you||they were|mightier|than you|(in) strength,|and more abundant|(in) wealth|and children.|So they enjoyed|their portion,|and you have enjoyed|your portion|like|enjoyed|those|before you||their portion,|and you indulge (in idle talk)|like the one who|indulges (in idle talk).|Those,|worthless,|(are) their deeds|in|the world|and (in) the Hereafter.|And those,|they|(are) the losers.
Has not|come to them|(the) news|(of) those who|(were) before them,||(the) people|(of) Nuh,|and Aad,|and Thamud,|and (the) people|(of) Ibrahim|and (the) companions|(of) Madyan,|and the towns overturned?|Came to them|their Messengers|with clear proofs.|And  not|was|Allah|to wrong them|but|they were to|themselves|doing wrong.
And the believing men|and the believing women,|some of them|(are) allies|(of) others.|They enjoin|the right,|and forbid|from|the wrong,|and they establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah,|and they obey|Allah|and His Messenger.|Those,|Allah will have mercy on them.||Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Allah has promised||(to) the believing men|and the believing women|Gardens,|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers|(will) abide forever|in it|and dwellings|blessed|in|Gardens|(of) everlasting bliss.|But the pleasure|of|Allah|(is) greater.|That,|it|(is) the success|great.
O Prophet ||Strive (against)|the disbelievers|and the hypocrites|and be stern|with them.|And their abode|(is) Hell,|and wretched|(is) the destination.
They swear|by Allah|(that) they said nothing,||while certainly|they said|(the) word|(of) the disbelief|and disbelieved|after|their (pretense of) Islam,|and planned|[of] what|not|they could attain.|And not|they were resentful|except|that|Allah had enriched them||and His Messenger|of|His Bounty.|So if|they repent,|it is|better|for them,|and if|they turn away,|Allah will punish them||(with) a punishment|painful,|in|the world|and (in) the Hereafter.|And not|for them|in|the earth|[of]|any protector|and not|any helper.
And among them|(is he) who|made a covenant|(with) Allah,|"If|He gives us|of|His bounty,|surely we will give charity|and surely we will be|among|the righteous."
But when|He gave them|of|His Bounty,|they became stingy|with it|and turned away|while they|(were) averse.
So He penalized them|(with) hypocrisy|in|their hearts|until|the day|when they will meet Him,|because|they broke|(the covenant) with Allah|what|they had promised Him,|and because|they used to|lie.
Do not|they know|that|Allah|knows|their secret|and their secret conversation,|and that|Allah|(is) All-Knower|(of) the unseen?
Those who|criticize|the ones who give willingly|of|the believers|concerning|the charities,|and those who|not|find|except|their effort,|so they ridicule|them,|Allah will ridicule||them,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
Ask forgiveness|for them|or|(do) not|ask forgiveness|for them.|If|you ask forgiveness|for them|seventy|times,|never|will Allah forgive||[for] them.|That|(is) because they|disbelieved|in Allah|and His Messenger,|and Allah|(does) not|guide|the people,|the defiantly disobedient.
Rejoice|those who remained behind|in their staying|behind|(the) Messenger|(of) Allah,|and they disliked|to|strive|with their wealth|and their lives|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|and they said,|"(Do) not|go forth|in|the heat."|Say,|"(The) Fire|(of) Hell|(is) more intense|(in) heat."|If (only)|they could|understand.
So let them laugh|a little,|and let them weep|much|(as) a recompense|for what|they used to|earn.
Then if|Allah returns you||to|a group|of them,|and they ask you permission|to go out,|then say,|"Never|will you come out|with me|ever|and never|will you fight|with me|any enemy.|Indeed, you|were satisfied|with sitting|(the) first|time,|so sit|with|those who stay behind."
And not|you pray|for|any|of them|who dies,|ever,|and not|you stand|by|his grave.|Indeed, they|disbelieved|in Allah|and His Messenger,|and died|while they were|defiantly disobedient.
And (let) not|impress you|their wealth|and their children.|Only|Allah intends||to|punish them|with it|in|the world,|and will depart|their souls|while they|(are) disbelievers.
And when|was revealed|a Surah|that;|believe|in Allah|and strive|with|His Messenger,|ask your permission|(the) men|(of) wealth|among them|and said,|"Leave us,|(to) be|with|those who sit."
They (were) satisfied|to|be|with|those who stay behind,|and were sealed|[on]|their hearts,|so they|(do) not|understand.
But|the Messenger|and those who|believed|with him|strove|with their wealth|and their lives.|And those,|for them|(are) the good things,|and those -|they|(are) the successful ones.
Allah has prepared||for them|Gardens|flows|from|underneath it|the rivers,|(will) abide forever|in it.|That|(is) the success|the great.
And came|the ones who make excuses|of|the bedouins,|that permission be granted|to them,|and sat,|those who|lied|(to) Allah|and His Messenger.|Will strike|those who|disbelieved|among them|a punishment|painful.
Not|on|the weak|and not|on|the sick|and not|on|those who|not|they find|what|they (can) spend|any blame|if|they (are) sincere|to Allah|and His Messenger.|Not|(is) on|the good-doers|[of]|any way (for blame).|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And not|on|those who,|when||they came to you|that you provide them with mounts,|you said,|"Not|I find|what|to mount you|on [it].|They turned back|with their eyes|flowing|[of]|(with) the tears,|(of) sorrow|that not|they find|what|they (could) spend.
Only|the way (blame)|(is) on|those who|ask your permission|while they|(are) rich.|They (are) satisfied|to|be|with|those who stay behind,|and Allah sealed||[on]|their hearts,|so they|(do) not|know.
They will make excuses|to you|when|you (have) returned|to them.|Say,|"(Do) not|make excuse,|never|we will believe|you.|Verily,|Allah (has) informed us||of|your news,|and Allah will see||your deeds,|and His Messenger.|Then|you will be brought back|to,|(the) Knower|(of) the unseen|and the seen,|then He will inform you|of what|you used (to)|do."
They will swear|by Allah|to you|when|you returned|to them,|that you may turn away|from them.|So turn away|from them,|indeed, they|(are) impure|and their abode|(is) Hell,|a recompense|for what|they used (to)|earn.
They swear|to you|that you may be pleased|with them.|But if|you are pleased|with them,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) not pleased||with|the people|(who are) defiantly disobedient.
The bedouins|(are) stronger|(in) disbelief|and hypocrisy,|and more likely|that not|they know|(the) limits|(of) what|Allah (has) revealed||to|His Messenger.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
And among|the bedouins|(is he) who|takes|what|he spends|(as) a loss,|and he awaits|for you|the turns (of misfortune).|Upon them|(will be) the turn|(of) the evil.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Knower.
But among|the bedouins|(is he) who,|believes|in Allah|and the Day|the Last,|and takes|what|he spends|(as) means of nearness|with|Allah|and blessings|(of) the Messenger.|Behold |Indeed, it|(is) a means of nearness|for them.|Allah will admit them||to|His Mercy.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And the forerunners,|the first|among|the emigrants|and the helpers|and those who|followed them|in righteousness,|Allah is pleased||with them,|and they are pleased|with Him.|And He has prepared|for them|Gardens|flows|underneath it|the rivers,|will abide|in it|forever.|That|(is) the success|the great.
And among those|around you|of|the bedouins|(are) hypocrites|and (also) from|people|(of) the Madinah.|They persist|in|the hypocrisy,|not|you know them,|We|[We] know them.|We will punish them|twice|then|they will be returned|to|a punishment|great.
And others|(who have) acknowledged|their sins.|They had mixed|a deed|righteous|(with) other|(that was) evil.|Perhaps|Allah|[that]|will turn (in mercy)|to them.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Take|from|their wealth|a charity,|purifying them|and cause them increase|by it,|and bless|[upon] them.|Indeed,|your invocations|(are a) reassurance|for them.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Knower.
Do not|they know|that|Allah|(is) He|(Who) accepts|the repentance|from|His slaves|and takes|the charities,|and that|Allah,|He|(is) the Acceptor of repentance,|the Most Merciful.
And say,|"Do,|then Allah will see||your deed|and His Messenger,|and the believers.|And you will be brought back|to|(the) Knower|(of) the unseen|and the seen,|then He will inform you|of what|you used (to)|do."
And others|deferred|for the Command of Allah -||whether|He will punish them|or|He will turn (in mercy)|to them.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
And those who|take|a masjid|(for causing) harm|and (for) disbelief,|and  (for) division|among|the believers,|and (as) a station|for whoever|warred|(against) Allah|and His Messenger|before.||And surely they will swear,|"Not|we wish|except|the good."|But Allah|bears witness|indeed, they|(are) surely liars.
(Do) not|stand|in it|ever.|A masjid|founded|on|the righteousness|from|(the) first|day|(is) more worthy|that|you stand|in it.|Within it|(are) men|who love|to|purify themselves,|and Allah|loves|the ones who purify themselves.
Then is (one) who|founded|his building|on|righteousness|from|Allah|and (His) pleasure|better|or|(one) who|founded|his building|on|edge|(of) a cliff|(about to) collapse,|so it collapsed|with him|in|(the) Fire|(of) Hell.|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the wrongdoing people.|
Not|(will) cease|their building|which|they built|a (cause of) doubt|in|their hearts|except|that|(are) cut into pieces|their hearts.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
Indeed,|Allah|(has) purchased|from|the believers|their lives|and their wealth,|because|for them|(is) Paradise.|They fight|in|(the) way|(of) Allah,|they slay|and they are slain.|A promise|upon Him|true,|in|the Taurat|and the Injeel|and the Quran.|And who|(is) more faithful|to his promise|than|Allah?|So rejoice|in your transaction|which|you have contracted|[with it].|And that|it|(is) the success|the great.
Those who turn in repentance,|those who worship,|those who praise,|those who go out,|those who bow down,|those who prostrate,|those who enjoin|the right|and those who forbid|[on]|the wrong,|and those who observe|(the) limits|(of) Allah.|And give glad tidings|(to) the believers.
Not|(it) is|for the Prophet|and those who|believe|that|they ask forgiveness|for the polytheists,|even though|they be|near of kin,||after||[what]|has become clear|to them,|that they|(are the) companions|(of) the Hellfire.
And not|was|(the) asking of forgiveness|(by) Ibrahim|for his father|except|because|(of) a promise|he had promised it|(to) him.|But when|it became clear|to him|that he|(was) an enemy|to Allah,|he disassociated|from him.|Indeed,|Ibrahim|(was) compassionate,|forbearing.
And not|is|(for) Allah|that He lets go astray|a people|after|[when]|He has guided them|until|He makes clear|to them|what|they should  fear.|Indeed,|Allah|(of) every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
Indeed,|Allah|to Him (belongs)|the dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|He gives life,|and He causes death.|And not|for you|besides Allah|||any|protector|and not|any helper.
Verily,|Allah turned (in mercy)||to|the Prophet,|and the emigrants,|and the helpers|[those] who|followed him,|in|(the) hour|(of) difficulty|after||[what]|had nearly|deviated|(the) hearts|(of) a party|of them,|then|He turned (in mercy)|to them.|Indeed, He|to them|(is) Most Kind,|Most Merciful.
And on|the three|(of) those who|were left behind,|until|when|(was) straitened|for them|the earth,|though|it was vast.|And (was) straitened|for them|their own souls|and they were certain|that|(there is) no|refuge|from|Allah|except|to Him.|Then|He turned (in mercy)|to them|that they may repent.|Indeed,|Allah,|He|(is) the Acceptor of repentance,|the Most Merciful.
O you who believe |||Fear|Allah|and be|with|those who are truthful.
Not|it was|(for) the people|of the Madinah|and who|were around them|of|the bedouins,|that|they remain behind|after|the Messenger|of Allah,|and not|they prefer|their lives|to|his life.|That is|because [they]|(does) not|afflict them|thirst|and not|fatigue|and not|hunger|in|(the) way|(of) Allah ,|and not|they step|any step|that angers|the disbelievers|and not|they inflict|on|an enemy|an infliction|except|is recorded|for them|in it|(as) a deed|righteous.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|allow to be lost|the reward|(of) the good-doers.
And not|they spend|any spending|small|and not|big,|and not|they cross|a valley|but|is recorded|for them,|that Allah may reward them||the best|(of) what|they used (to)|do.
And not|is|(for) the believers|that they go forth|all together.|So if not|go forth|from|every|group|among them|a party|that they may obtain understanding|in|the religion,|and that they may warn|their people|when|they return|to them,|so that they may|beware.
O you who believe |||Fight|those who|(are) close to you|of|the disbelievers,|and let them find|in you|harshness.|And know|that|Allah|(is) with|those who fear (Him).
And whenever||is revealed|a Surah,|among them|(are some) who|say,|"Which of you|(has) increased [it]|(by) this|(in) faith?"|As for|those who|believe|then it has increased them|(in) faith|and they|rejoice.
But as for|those,|in|their hearts|(is) a disease,|(it) increases them|(in) evil|to|their evil.|And they die|while they|(are) disbelievers.
Do not|they see|that they|are  tried|[in]|every|year|once|or|twice?|Yet|not|they turn (in repentance),|and not|they|pay heed.
And whenever||is revealed|a Surah,|look|some of them|to|others,|"Does|see you|any|one?"|Then|they turn away.|Allah has turned away||their hearts|because they|(are) a people|not|they understand.
Certainly,|(has) come to you|a Messenger|from|yourselves.|Grievous|to him|(is) what|you suffer,|(he is) concerned|over you,|to the believers|(he is) kind|(and) merciful.
But if|they turn away,|then say,|"Sufficient for me|(is) Allah.|(There is) no|god|except|Him.|On Him|I put my trust.|And He|(is the) Lord|(of) the Throne,|the Great."
Alif Lam Ra.|These|(are the) verses|(of) the Book|the wise.
Is it|for the mankind|a wonder|that|We revealed|to|a man|from (among) them|that,|"Warn|the mankind|and give glad tidings|(to) those who|believe|that|for them|(will be) a respectable position||near|their Lord?"|Said|the disbelievers,|"Indeed,|this|(is) surely a magician|obvious."
Indeed,|your Lord|(is) Allah|the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|in|six|periods,|then|He established|on|the Throne,|disposing|the affairs.|Not|(is) any intercessor||except|after||His permission.|That|(is) Allah,|your Lord,|so worship Him.|Then will not|you remember?
To Him,|(will be) your return|[all].|Promise|(of) Allah|(is) true.|Indeed, He|originates|the creation,|then|He repeats it,|that He may reward|those who|believed|and did|the good deeds,|in justice.|But those who|disbelieved,|for them|(will be) a drink|of|boiling fluids|and a punishment|painful,|because|they used (to)|disbelieve.
He|(is) the One Who|made|the sun|a shining light,|and the moon|a reflected light|and determined for it|phases,|that you may know|(the) number|(of) the years|and the count (of time).|Not|created|Allah|that|except|in truth.|He explains|the Signs|for a people|(who) know.
Indeed,|in|(the) alternation|(of) the night|and the day|and what|Allah has created||in|the heavens,|and the earth|(are) Signs|for a people|who are God conscious.
Indeed,|those who|(do) not|expect|the meeting with Us|and are pleased|with the life|(of) the world,|and feel satisfied|with it|and those -|they|(are) of|Our Signs,|heedless.
Those -|their abode|(will be) the Fire,|for what|they used (to)|earn.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and did|good deeds,|(will) guide them|their Lord,|by their faith.|Will flow|from|underneath them|the rivers,|in|Gardens|(of) Delight.
Their prayer|therein|(will be), "Glory be to You,|O Allah "|And their greeting|therein (will be),|"Peace."|And the last|(of) their call|(will be) [that]|"All the Praise be|to Allah,|Lord|(of) the worlds."
And if|Allah (was) to hasten||for the mankind|the evil,|(as) He hastens for them|the good,|surely, would have been decreed|for them|their term.|But We leave|those who|(do) not|expect|the meeting with Us,|in|their transgression,|wandering blindly.
And when|touches|the man|the affliction|he calls Us,|(lying) on his side|or|sitting|or|standing.|But when|We remove|from him|his affliction|he passes on|as if he|(had) not|called Us|for|(the) affliction|(that) touched him.|Thus|(it) is made fair seeming|to the extravagant|what|they used (to)|do.
And verily|We destroyed|the generations|before you||when|they wronged,|and came to them|their Messengers|with clear proofs,|but not|they were|to believe.|Thus|We recompense|the people|(who are) criminals.
Then|We made you|successors|in|the earth|after them||so that We may see|how|you do.
And when|are recited|to them|Our Verses|(as) clear proofs|said|those who|(do) not|hope|(for the) meeting (with) Us,|"Bring us|a Quran|other (than)|this|or|change it."|Say,|"Not|(it) is|for me|that|I change it|of|my own accord.||Not|I follow|except|what|is revealed|to me.|Indeed, I|[I] fear|if|I were to disobey|my Lord,|(the) punishment|(of) a Great Day."|
Say,|"If|Allah (had) willed,||not|I (would) have recited it|to you,|and not|He (would) have made it known to you.||Verily,|I have stayed|among you|a lifetime||before it.|Then will not|you use reason?"
So who|(is) more wrong|than he who|invents|against|Allah|a lie|or|denies|His Signs?|Indeed,|not|will succeed|the criminals.
And they worship|other than Allah|||that (which)|(does) not|harm them|and not|benefit them,|and they say,|"These|(are) our intercessors|with|Allah."|Say,|"Do you inform|Allah|of what|He does not know||in|the heavens|and not|in|the earth?"|Glorified is He|and Exalted|above what|they associate (with Him).
And not|was|the mankind|but|one community,||then they differed.|And had (it) not been|a word|(that) preceded|from|your Lord,|surely, it (would) have been judged|between them|concerning what|[therein]|they differ.
And they say,|"Why not|is sent down|to him|a Sign|from|his Lord?"|So say,|"Only|the unseen|(is) for Allah,|so wait;|indeed, I am|with you|among|the ones who wait."
And when|We let [the] mankind taste||mercy|after||adversity|has touched them,|behold |They have|a plot|against|Our Verses.|Say,|"Allah|(is) more swift|(in) planning."|Indeed,|Our Messengers|write down|what|you plot.
He|(is) the One Who|enables you to travel|in|the land|and the sea,|until,|when|you are|in|the ships|and they sail|with them|with a wind|good,|and they rejoice|therein|comes to it|a wind|stormy,|and comes to them|the waves|from|every|place,|and they assume|that they|are surrounded|with them.|They call|Allah|sincerely|to Him|(in) the religion,|(saying), "If|You save us|from|this,|surely we will be|among|the thankful."
But when|He saved them,|behold |They|rebel|in|the earth|without|[the] right.|O mankind ||Only|your rebellion|(is) against|yourselves,|(the) enjoyment|(of) the life|(of) the world.|Then|to Us|(is) your return|and We will inform you|of what|you used (to)|do.
Only|(the) example|(of) the life|(of) the world|(is) like (the) water|which We sent down|from|the sky,|so absorbs|[with] it,|(the) plants|(of) the earth|from which|eat|the men|and the cattle,|until|when|takes|the earth|its adornment|and is beautified|and think|its people|that they|have the power|over it,|comes (to) it|Our command|(by) night|or|(by) day,|and We make it|a harvest clean-mown,|as if|not|it had flourished|yesterday.|Thus|We explain|the Signs|for a people|who reflect.
And Allah|calls|to|(the) Home|(of) the Peace,|and guides|whom|He wills|to|(the) straight path.|
For those who|do good|(is) the best|and more.|And not|(will) cover|their faces|dust|and not|humiliation.|Those|(are the) companions|(of) Paradise,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
And those who|earned|the evil deeds,|(the) recompense|(of) an evil deed|(is) like it,|and (will) cover them|humiliation.|They will not have||from|Allah|any|defender.|As if|had been covered|their faces|(with) pieces|from|the darkness (of) night.||Those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
And (the) Day|We will gather them|all together,|then|We will say|to those who|associate partners (with Allah),|"(Remain in) your place|you|and your partners."|Then We will separate|[between] them,|and (will) say|their partners,|"Not|you used (to)|worship us."|
So sufficient|(is) Allah|(as) a witness|between us|and between you|that|we were|of|your worship|certainly unaware.
There|will be put to trial|every|soul|(for) what|it did previously,|and they will be  returned|to|Allah|their Lord|the true,|and will be lost|from them|what|they used (to)|invent.
Say,|"Who|provides for you|from|the sky|and the earth?|Or who|controls|the hearing|and the sight?|And who|brings out|the living|from|the dead,|and brings forth|the dead|from|the living?|And who|disposes|the affairs?"|Then they will say,|"Allah."|Then say,|"Then will not|you fear (Him)?"
For that|(is) Allah,|your Lord,|the true.|So what (can be)|after|the truth|except|the error?|So how|(are) you turned away.
Thus|(is) proved true|(the) Word|(of) your Lord|upon|those who|defiantly disobeyed,|that they|(will) not|believe.
Say,|"Is (there)|of|your partners|(any) who|originates|the creation|then|repeats it?"|Say,|"Allah|originates|the creation|then|repeats it.|So how|you are deluded?"
Say,|"Is (there)|of|your partners|(any) who|guides|to|the truth?"|Say,|"Allah|guides|to the truth.|Is then (he) who|guides|to|the truth|more worthy|that|he should be followed|or (he) who|(does) not|guide|unless|[that]|he is guided?|Then what|(is) for you,|how|you judge?"
And not|follow|most of them|except|assumption.|Indeed,|the assumption|(does) not|avail|against|the truth|anything.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knower|of what|they do.
And not|is|this|the Quran,|that|(it could be) produced|by|other than Allah,||but|(it is) a confirmation|(of that) which|(was) before it||and a detailed explanation|(of) the Book,|(there is) no|doubt|in it,|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Or|(do) they say,|"He has invented it?"|Say,|"Then bring|a Surah|like it|and call|whoever|you can|besides Allah,|||if|you are|truthful."
Nay,|they denied|what|not|they could encompass|(of) its knowledge|and not|has come (to) them|its interpretation.|Thus|denied|those|before them,||then see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the wrongdoers.
And of them|(is one) who|believes|in it,|and of them|(is one) who|(does) not|believe|in it.|And your Lord|(is) All-Knower|of the corrupters.
And if|they deny you|then say,|"For me|(are) my deeds,|and for you|(are) your deeds.|You|(are) disassociated|from what|I do,|and I am|disassociated|from what|you do."
And among them|(are some) who|listen|to you.|But (can) you|cause the deaf to hear||even though|they [were]|(do) not|use reason?
And among them|(are some) who|look|at you.|But (can) you|guide|the blind|even though|they [were]|(do) not|see?
Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|wrong|the people|(in) anything,|but|the people|wrong themselves.|
And the Day|He will gather them,|as if|they had not remained||except|an hour|of|the day,|they will recognize each other|between them.|Certainly,|(will have) lost|those who|denied|the meeting|(with) Allah,|and not|they were|the guided ones.
And whether|We show you|some|(of) that which|We promised them|or|We cause you to die,|then to Us|(is) their return,|then|Allah|(is) a Witness|over|what|they do.
And for every|nation|(is) a Messenger.|So when|comes|their Messenger,|it will be judged|between them|in justice,|and they|(will) not|be wronged.
And they say,|"When|(will) this,|the promise (be fulfilled),|if|you are|truthful?"
Say,|"Not|I have power|for myself|(for) any harm|and not|(for) any profit|except|what|Allah wills.||For every|nation|(is) a term.|When|comes|their term,|then not|they remain behind|an hour,|and not|they can precede (it)."
Say,|"Do you see,|if|comes to you|His punishment|(by) night|or|(by) day,|what (portion)|of it would (wish to) hasten||the criminals?"
Is (it) then|when||(it had) occurred|you (will) believe|in it?|Now?|And certainly|you were|seeking to hasten it.|
Then|it will be said|to those who|wronged,|"Taste|punishment|the everlasting.|Are you (being) recompensed||except|for what|you used (to)|earn?"
And they ask you to inform|"Is it true?"||Say,|"Yes,|by my Lord |Indeed, it|(is) surely the truth,|and not|you|(can) escape (it)."
And if|that|for every|soul|(that) wronged,|whatever|(is) in|the earth,|it (would) seek to  ransom|with it,|and they (will) confide|the regret|when|they see|the punishment.|But will be judged|between them|in justice,|and they|(will) not|be wronged.
No doubt,|indeed,|for Allah|(is) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|No doubt|indeed,|(the) Promise of Allah||(is) true.|But|most of them|(do) not|know.
He|gives life|and causes death,|and to Him|you will be returned.
O mankind ||Verily|has come to you|an instruction|from|your Lord,|and a healing|for what|(is) in|your breasts,|and guidance|and mercy|for the believers.
Say,|"In the Bounty of Allah||and in His Mercy|so in that|let them rejoice."|It|(is) better|than what|they accumulate.
Say,|"Have you seen|what|Allah has sent down||for you|of|(the) provision,|and you have made|of it|unlawful|and lawful?"|Say,|"Has Allah|permitted|[to] you,|or|against|Allah|you invent (lies)?"
And what|(will be the) assumption|(of) those who|invent|against|Allah|the lie|(on) the Day|(of) the Judgment?|Indeed,|Allah|(is) surely Full (of) Bounty||to|the mankind,|but|most of them|(are) not|grateful.
And not|you are|[in]|any situation,|and not|you recite|of it|from|(the) Quran|and not|you do|any|deed|except|We are|over you|witnesses|when|you are engaged|in it.|And not|escapes|from|your Lord|of|(the) weight|(of) an atom|in|the earth,|and not|in|the heavens|and not|smaller|than|that|and not|greater|but|(is) in|a Record|clear.
No doubt |Indeed,|(the) friends of Allah||(there will be) no|fear|upon then|and not|they|will grieve.
Those who|believe|and are|conscious (of Allah),
For them|(are) the glad tidings|in|the life|(of) the world|and in|the Hereafter.|change|(There can be) no|in the Words of Allah.||That|is|the success|the great.
And (let) not|grieve you|their speech.|Indeed,|the honor|(belongs) to Allah|all.|He|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Knower.
No doubt |Indeed,|to Allah (belongs)|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and whoever|(is) in|the earth.|And not|follow|those who|invoke|other than Allah|||partners.|Not|they follow|but|the assumption|and not|they|but|guess.
He|(is) the One Who|made|for you|the night|that you may rest|in it|and the day|giving visibility.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for a people|(who) listen.
They say,|"Allah has taken||a son."|Glory be to Him |He|(is) the Self-sufficient.|To Him (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|Not|you have|any|authority|for this.|Do you say|about|Allah|what|not|you know?
Say,|"Indeed|those who|invent|against|Allah|the lie,|they will not succeed."|
An enjoyment|in|the world,|then|to Us|(is) their return,|then|We will make them taste|the punishment|the severe|because|they used to|disbelieve.
And recite|to them|the news|(of) Nuh|when|he said|to his people,|"O my people |If|is|hard|on you|my stay|and my reminding|the Signs of Allah,||then on|Allah|I put my trust.|So you all resolve|your plan|and your partners.|Then|let not be||(in) your plan|for you|any doubt.|Then|carry (it out)|upon me|and (do) not|give me respite.
But if|you turn away|then not|I have asked you|any|reward.|Not|(is) my reward|but|on|Allah,|and I have been commanded|that|I be|of|the Muslims."
But they denied him,|so We saved him|and (those) who|(were) with him|in|the ship,|and We made them|successors,|and We drowned|those who|denied|Our Signs.|Then see|how|was|(the) end|(of) those who were warned.
Then|We sent|after him||Messengers|to|their people,|and they came to them|with clear proofs.|But not|they were|to believe|what|they had denied|[it]|before.||Thus|We seal|[on]|the hearts|(of) the transgressors.
Then|We sent|after them||Musa|and Harun|to|Firaun|and his chiefs|with Our Signs,|but they were arrogant|and were|a people|criminal.
So when|came to them|the truth|from Us,||they said,|"Indeed|this|(is) surely, a magic|clear."
Musa said,||"Do you say|about the truth|when|it has come to you?|Is this magic?||But (will) not|succeed|the magicians."
They said,|"Have you come to us|to turn us away|from that|we found|on it|our forefathers,|and you two (may) have||the greatness|in|the land?|And we (are) not||(in) you two|believers."
And Firaun said,||"Bring to me|every|magician|learned."
So when|came|the magicians,|said|to them|Musa,|"Throw|whatever|you|(wish to) throw."
Then when|they (had) thrown,|Musa said,||"What|you have brought|[it]|(is) the magic.|Indeed,|Allah|will nullify it.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|amend|the work|(of) the corrupters.
And Allah will establish||the truth|by His words,|even if|dislike it|the criminals."
But none|believed|Musa|except|(the) offspring|among|his people|for|fear|of|Firaun|and their chiefs,|lest|they persecute them.|And indeed,|Firaun|(was) a tyrant|in|the earth,|and indeed, he|(was) of|the ones who commit excesses.
And Musa said,||"O my people |If|you have|believed|in Allah,|then on Him|put your trust,|if|you are|Muslims."
Then they said,|"Upon|Allah|we put our trust.|Our Lord |(Do) not|make us|a trial|for the people -|the wrongdoers.
And save us|by Your Mercy|from|the people -|the  disbelievers."
And We inspired|to|Musa|and his brother|that,|"Settle|your people|in Egypt|(in) houses,|and make|your houses|(as) places of worship,|and establish|the prayer.|And give glad tidings|(to) the believers."
And Musa said,||"Our Lord |Indeed, You|have given|Firaun|and his chiefs|splendor|and wealth|in|the life|(of) the world.|Our Lord |That they may lead astray|from|Your way.|Our Lord |Destroy|[on]|their wealth|and harden|[on]|their hearts,|so (that) not|they believe|until|they see|the punishment -|the painful."
He said,|"Verily,|has been answered|(the) invocation of both of you.|So you two (keep to the) straight way.|And (do) not|follow|(the) way|(of) those who|(do) not|know."
And We took across|(the) Children|(of) Israel -|the sea,|and followed them|Firaun|and his hosts|(in) rebellion|and enmity,|until|when|overtook him|the drowning,|he said,|"I believe|that|(there is) no|god|except|the One,|in Whom believe||the Children of Israel,||and I am|of|the Muslims."
"Now?|And verily,|you (had) disobeyed|before|and you were|of|the corrupters?"
So today|We will save you|in your body,|that you may be|for (those) who|succeed you|a sign.|And indeed,|many|among|the mankind|of|Our Signs|(are) surely heedless."
And verily,|We settled|(the) Children|(of) Israel|(in) a settlement|honorable,|and We provided them|with|the good things,|and not|they differ|until|came to them|the knowledge.|Indeed,|your Lord|will judge|between them|(on) the Day|(of) the Resurrection,|concerning what|they used (to)|[in it]|differ.
So if|you are|in|doubt|of what|We have revealed|to you,|then ask|those who|(have been) reading|the Book|before you.||Verily,|has come to you|the truth|from|your Lord,|so (do) not|be|among|the doubters.
And (do) not|be|of|those who|deny|(the) Signs of Allah,||then you will be|among|the losers.
Indeed,|those [whom],|has become due|on them|(the) Word|(of) your Lord|will not|believe.
Even if|comes to them|every|Sign|until|they see|the punishment -|the painful.
So why not|was|any town|that believed,|and benefited it|its faith,|except|the people|(of) Yunus?|When|they believed,|We removed|from them|(the) punishment|(of) the disgrace|in|the life|of the world|and We granted them enjoyment|for|a time.
And if|(had) willed|your Lord|surely, (would) have believed|who|(are) in|the earth|all of them|together.|Then, will you|compel|the mankind|until|they become|believers?
And not|is|for a soul|to|believe|except|by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|And He will place|the wrath|on|those who|(do) not|use reason.
Say,|"See,|what|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth."|But not|will avail|the Signs|and the warners|to|a people|(who do) not|believe.
Then do|they wait|except|like|the days|(of) those who|passed away|before them?||Say,|"Then wait|indeed, I (am)|with you|among|the ones who wait."
Then|We will save|Our Messengers|and those who|believe.|Thus,|(it is) an obligation|upon Us|(that) We save|the believers.
Say,|"O mankind ||If|you are|in|doubt|of|my religion,|then not|I worship|those whom|you worship|besides Allah,|||but|I worship|Allah,|the One Who|causes you to die.|And I am commanded|that|I be|of|the believers."
And that,|"Direct|your face|to the religion|upright,|and (do) not|be|of|the polytheists.
And (do) not|invoke|besides Allah|||what|(will) not|benefit you|and not|harm you.|But if|you did so|indeed, you|then (will be)|of|the wrongdoers."
And if|Allah touches you||with adversity|(there is) no|remover|of it|except|Him,|and if|He intends for you|any good|then (there is) no|repeller|(of) His Bounty.|He causes it to reach||whom|He wills|of|His slaves.|And He|(is) the Oft-Forgiving,|the Most Merciful.
Say,|"O mankind ||Verily|has come to you|the truth|from|your Lord.|So whoever|(is) guided|then only|(he is) guided|for his soul,|and whoever|goes astray|then only|he strays|against it.|And I am not||over you|a guardian."
And follow|what|is revealed|to you|and be patient|until|Allah gives judgment.||And He|(is) the Best|(of) the Judges.
Alif Lam Ra.|(This is) a Book|are perfected|its Verses|moreover,|explained in detail|from (the One Who)||(is) All-Wise,|All-Aware.
That, "Not|you worship|but|Allah.|"Indeed, I am|to you|from Him|a warner|and a bearer of glad tidings.
And that|"Seek forgiveness|(of) your Lord|and|turn in repentance|to Him,|He will let you|enjoy|a good|for|a term|appointed.|And give|(to) every|owner|(of) grace|His Grace.|But if|you turn away|then indeed, I|fear|for you|(the) punishment|(of) a Great Day.|
To|Allah|(is) your return,|and He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful."
No doubt |They|fold up|their breasts|that they may hide|from Him.|Surely,|when|they cover (themselves)|(with) their garments,|He knows|what|they conceal|and what|they reveal.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Knower|of what|(is in) the breasts.
And not|any|moving creature|in|the earth|but|on|Allah|(is) its provision.|And He knows|its dwelling place|and its place of storage.|All|(is) in|a Record|clear.
And He|(is) the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|in|six|epochs,|and His throne was||on|the water|that He might test [you]|which of you|(is) best|(in) deed.|But if|you say,|"Indeed, you|(will be) resurrected|after||[the] death,"|surely would say|those who|disbelieved,|"This is not||but|a magic|clear."
And if|We delay|from them|the punishment|for|a time|determined,|they will surely say,|"What|detains it?"|No doubt |(On) the Day|it comes to them|not|(will be) averted|from them|and will surround|them|what|they used (to)|mock at [it].|
And if|We give man a taste||(of) Mercy from Us,||then|We withdraw it|from him,|indeed, he|(is) despairing|(and) ungrateful.
But if|We give him a taste|(of) favor|after|hardship|(has) touched him,|surely, he will say,|"Have gone|the evils|from me."|Indeed, he|(is) exultant|(and) boastful.
Except|those who|(are) patient|and do|the good deeds,|those|for them|(will be) forgiveness|and a reward|great.
Then possibly you|(may) give up|a part|(of) what|is revealed|to you|and straitened|by it|your breast|because|they say,|"Why not|is sent down|for him|a treasure|or|has come|with him|an Angel?"|Only|you|(are) a warner.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|a Guardian.
Or|they say,|"He has fabricated it."|Say,|"Then bring|ten|Surahs|like it|fabricated,|and call|whoever|you can|besides Allah|||if|you are|truthful."
Then if not|they respond|to you|then know|that|it was sent down|with the knowledge of Allah,||and that|(there is) no|god|except|Him.|Then, would|you|(be) Muslims?
Whoever [is]||desires|the life|(of) the world|and its adornments,|We will repay in full|to them|(for) their deeds|therein,|and they|in it|will not be lessened.|
Those|(are) the ones who -|(is) not|for them|in|the Hereafter|except|the Fire.|And (has) gone in vain|what|they did|therein,|and (is) worthless|what|they used (to)|do.
Then is he who|is|on|a clear proof|from|his Lord,|and recites it,|a witness|from Him,|and before it||(was) a Book|(of) Musa|(as) a guide|and (as) mercy?|Those|believe|in it.|But whoever|disbelieves|in it|among|the sects,|then the Fire|(will be) his promised (meeting) place.|So (do) not|be|in|doubt|about it.|Indeed, it|(is) the truth|from|your Lord,|but|most|(of) the people|(do) not|believe.
And who|(is) more unjust|than (he) who|invents|against|Allah|a lie?|Those|will be presented|before|their Lord,|and will say|the witnesses,|"These (are)|those who|lied|against|their Lord."|No doubt |(The) curse of Allah||(is) on|the wrongdoers.
Those who|hinder|from|(the) way|(of) Allah|and seek (in) it|crookedness,|while they|in the Hereafter|[they]|(are) disbelievers.
Those|not|will be|(able to) escape|in|the earth|and not|is|for them|besides||Allah|any|protectors.|And will be doubled|for them|the punishment.|Not|they were|able|(to) hear|and not|they used (to)|see.
Those|(are) the ones who|(have) lost|their souls,|and lost|from them|(is) what|they used|(to) invent.
No|doubt|that they|in|the Hereafter|[they]|(will be) the greatest losers.
Indeed,|those who|believe|and do|good deeds|and humble themselves|before|their Lord,|those|(are the) companions|(of) Paradise,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
(The) example|(of) the two parties|(is) like the blind|and the deaf,|and the seer|and the hearer.|Are|they equal|(in) comparison?|Then, will not|you take heed?
And verily|We sent|Nuh|to|his people,|"Indeed, I am|to you|a warner|clear.
That|(do) not|worship|except|Allah.|Indeed, I|[I] fear|for you|(the) punishment|(of) a Day|painful."
So said|the chiefs|(of) those who|disbelieved|from|his people,|"Not|we see you|but|a man|like us,|and not|we see you|followed [you]|except|those who|[they]|(are) the lowest of us|immature in opinion.||And not|we see|in you|over us|any|merit;|nay,|we think you|(are) liars."
He said,|"O my people |Do you see|if|I was|on|(the) clear proof|from|my Lord,|while He has given me|mercy|from|Himself|but (it) has been obscured|from you,|should  We compel you (to accept) it|while you (are)|averse to it?|
And O my people |not|I ask (of) you|for it|any wealth.|Not|(is) my reward|except|from|Allah.|And not|I am|going to drive away|those who|believed.|Indeed, they|(will) be meeting|their Lord,|but I|see you|(are) a people|ignorant.
And O my people |Who|would help me|against|Allah|if|I drove them away?|Then, will not|you take heed?
And not|I say|to you|(that) with me|(are the) treasures|(of) Allah,|and not|I know|the unseen,|and not|I say|that I am|an Angel,|and not|I say|for those whom|look down upon|your eyes,|never|will Allah give them||any good.|Allah|knows best|what|(is) in|their souls.|Indeed, I|then|(will be) surely of|the wrongdoers."
They said,|"O Nuh |Indeed,|you disputed with us|and you (have been) frequent|(in) dispute with us.|So bring us|what|you threaten us (with),|if|you are|of|the truthful."
He said,|"Only|will bring it (on) you||Allah,|if|He wills,|and not|you (are)|one who (can) escape (it).
And (will) not|benefit you|my advice|(even) if|I wish|to|[I] advise|[to] you,|if|it was Allah's||will|to|let you go astray.|He (is)|your Lord,|and to Him|you will be returned."
Or|(do) they say,|"He has invented it?"|Say,|"If|I have invented it,|then on me|(is) my crime,|but I am|innocent|of what|crimes you commit."
And it was revealed|to|Nuh,|"That|will never|believe|from|your people|except|(those) who|have already|believed.|So (do) not|(be) distressed|by what|they have been|doing.
And construct|the ship|under Our Eyes,|and Our inspiration|and (do) not|address Me|concerning|those who|wronged;|indeed, they (are)|the ones (to be) drowned."
And he was constructing|the ship,|and every time|passed|by him|(the) chiefs|of|his people,|they ridiculed|[of] him.|He said,|"If|you ridicule|us,|then we|can ridicule|you|as|you ridicule.
And soon|you will know|(on) whom|will come|a punishment|(that) will disgrace him,|and will descend|on him|a punishment|lasting."
Till|when|came|Our command,|and overflowed|the oven,|We said,|"Load|in it|of|every kind|a pair|two,|and your family|except|who|has preceded|against him|the word,|and whoever|believed."|And not|believed|with him|except|a few.
And he said,|"Embark|in it,|in the name|of Allah|(is) its course|and its anchorage.|Indeed,|my Lord|(is) certainly Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful."
And it|sailed|with them|on|the waves|like mountains,|and Nuh called out||(to) his son,|and he was|[in]|apart,|"O my son |Embark|with us|and (do) not|be|with|the disbelievers."
He said,|"I will betake myself|to|a mountain,|(that) will save me|from|the water."|He said,|"(There is) no|protector|today|from|the Command of Allah||except,|(on) whom|He has mercy."|And came|(in) between them|the waves,|so he was|among|the drowned.
And it was said,|"O earth |Swallow|your water,|and O sky |Withhold."|And subsided|the water,|and was fulfilled|the Command.|And it rested|on|the Judi.|And it was said,|"Away|with the people|the wrongdoers."
And Nuh called||(to) his Lord|and said,|"O my Lord |Indeed,|my son|(is) of|my family,|and indeed,|Your promise|(is) true,|and You|(are) the Most Just|(of) the judges."
He said,|"O Nuh |Indeed, he|(is) not|of|your family;|indeed, [he]|(his) deed|(is) other than|righteous,|so (do) not|ask Me|(about) what|not|you have|of it|any knowledge.|Indeed, I|admonish you|lest|you be|among|the ignorant."
He said,|"O my Lord |Indeed, I|seek refuge|in You,|that|I (should) ask You|what|not|I have|of it|knowledge.|And unless|You forgive|me|and You have mercy on me,|I will be|among|the losers."
It was said,|"O Nuh |Go down|with peace|from Us|and blessings|on you|and on|the nations|from those|with you.|But (to other) nations|We will grant enjoyment;|then|will touch them|from Us|a punishment|painful."
This|(is) from|the news|(of) the unseen,|(which) We reveal|to you.|Not|you were|knowing it,|you|and not|your people|before||this.|So be patient;|indeed,|the end|(is) for the God fearing."
And to|Aad|(We sent) their brother|Hud.|He said,|"O my people |Worship|Allah,|not|(is) for you|any|god,|other than Him.|Not|you|(are) but|inventors."
O my people |Not|I ask you|for it|any reward.|Not|(is) my reward|except|from|the One Who|created me.|Then will not|you use reason?
And O my people |Ask forgiveness|(of) your Lord,|then|turn in repentance|to Him.|He will send|(from) the sky (rain)|upon you|(in) abundance|and increases you|(in) strength|(added) to|your strength.|And (do) not|turn away|(as) criminals."
They said,|"O Hud |You have not brought us||clear proofs,|and not|we|(will) leave|our gods|on|your saying,|and not|we (are)|in you|believers.
Not|we say,|except (that),|have seized you|some|(of) our gods|with evil."|He said,|"Indeed, I|[I] call Allah to witness||and (you) bear witness|that I am|innocent|of what|you associate,
Other than Him.||So plot against me|all together,|then|(do) not|give me respite.
Indeed, I|[I] put my trust|upon|Allah|my Lord,|and your Lord.|(There is) not|of a moving creature||but|He|has grasp|of its forelock.|Indeed,|my Lord|(is) on|a path|straight.
So if|you turn away,|then verily|I have conveyed to you|what|I was sent|with [it]|to you.|And my Lord will give succession||(to) a people|other than you,|and not|you will harm Him|(in) anything.|Indeed,|my Lord|(is) on|all|things|a Guardian."
And when|came|Our command,|We saved|Hud|and those who|believed|with him,|by a Mercy|from Us|and We saved them|from|a punishment|severe.
And this|(was) Aad,|they rejected|(the) Signs|(of) their Lord|and disobeyed|His Messengers|and followed|(the) command|(of) every|tyrant|obstinate.
And they were followed|in|this|world|(with) a curse|and (on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|No doubt |Indeed,|Aad|disbelieved|their Lord,|So|away|with Aad,|(the) people|(of) Hud.
And to|Thamud|(We sent) their brother|Salih.|He said,|"O my people |Worship|Allah,|not|you have|any|god|other than Him.|He|produced you|from|the earth|and settled you|in it.|So ask forgiveness of Him,|then|turn in repentance|to Him.|Indeed,|my Lord|(is) near,|All-Responsive."
They said,|O Salih |Verily|you were|among us|the one in whom hope was placed|before|this.|Do you forbid us|that|we worship|what||our forefathers worshipped?|And indeed we|surely (are) in|doubt|about what|you call us|to it,|suspicious."
He said,|"O my people |Do you see,|if|I am|on|a clear proof|from|my Lord,|and He has given me|from Him,|a Mercy|then who|(can) help me|against|Allah,|if|I (were to) disobey Him?|So not|you would increase me|but|(in) loss.
And O my people |This|she-camel|(of) Allah|(is) for you|a Sign,|so leave her|to eat|in|the earth|(of) Allah,|and (do) not|touch her|with harm,|lest will seize you|a punishment|impending."
But they hamstrung her.|So he said,|"Enjoy (yourselves)|in|your home(s)|(for) three|days.|That|(is) a promise|not|(to) be belied."
So when|came|Our command|We saved|Salih,|and those who|believed|with him,|by a Mercy|from Us,|and from|(the) disgrace|(of) that Day.|Indeed,|your Lord,|He|(is) All- Strong,|All-Mighty.
And seized|those who|wronged,|the thunderous blast|then they became|in|their homes|fallen prone.
As if|not|they (had) prospered|therein.|No doubt,|indeed,|Thamud|disbelieved|(in) their Lord,|so|away|with Thamud.
And certainly|came|Our messengers|(to) Ibrahim|with glad tidings,|they said,|"Peace."|He said,|"Peace,"|and not he delayed||to|bring|a calf|roasted.
But when|he saw|their hands|not|reaching|to it,|he felt unfamiliar of them|and felt apprehension|from them|[a fear].|They said,|"(Do) not|fear.|Indeed, we|[we] have been sent|to|(the) people|(of) Lut."
And his wife|(was) standing|and she laughed.|Then We gave her glad tidings|of Ishaq,|and after||Ishaq|(of) Yaqub.
She said,|"Woe to me |Shall I bear a child|while I am|an old woman|and this,|my husband,|(is) an old man?|Indeed,|this|(is) surely a thing|amazing."
They said,|"Are you amazed|at|(the) decree of Allah?||The Mercy of Allah||and His blessings|(be) upon you,|people|(of) the house.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Praiseworthy,|All-Glorious."
And when|(had) gone away|from|Ibrahim|the fright,|and had reached him|the glad tidings,|he argued with Us,|concerning|the people|of Lut.
Indeed,|Ibrahim|(was) certainly forbearing,|imploring,|and oft-returning.
O Ibrahim |Turn away|from|this.|Indeed, it|certainly|has come,|(the) Command|(of) your Lord|and indeed, [they]|(will) come (for) them|a punishment|(which) cannot|(be) repelled.
And when|came|Our messengers|(to) Lut,|he was distressed|for them|and felt straitened|for them|(and) uneasy,|and said,|"This|(is) a day|distressful."
And came (to) him|his people|rushing,|to him,|and before||they (had) been|doing|the evil deeds.|He said,|"O my people |These|(are) my daughters,|they|(are) purer|for you.|So fear|Allah|and (do) not|disgrace me|concerning|my guests.|Is (there) not|among you|a man|right-minded?"
They said,|"Verily|you know|(that) not|we have|concerning|your daughters|any|right.|And indeed, you|surely know|what|we want."
He said,|"If|that|I had|over you|power|or|I could take refuge|in|a support|strong."
They said,|"O Lut |Indeed, we|(are) messengers|(of) your Lord,|never|they will reach|you.|So travel|with your family|in a part|of|the night|and (let) not|look back|anyone of you,||except|your wife.|Indeed, it|will strike her|what|will strike them.|Indeed,|their appointed time|(is) morning|Is not|the morning|near?"
So when|came|Our Command,|We made|its upside,|its downside,|and We rained|upon them|stones|of|baked clay|(in) layers.
Marked|from|your Lord.|And not|it|(is) from|the wrongdoers|far.
And to|Madyan,|their brother|Shuaib.|He said,|"O my people |Worship|Allah|not|(is) for you|any|god|other than Him.|And (do) not|decrease|(from) the measure|and the scale.|Indeed, I|see you|in prosperity,|but indeed, I|fear|for you|punishment|(of) a Day|all-encompassing.
And O my people |Give full|measure,|and weight|in justice|and (do) not|deprive|the people|(of) their things,|and (do) not|act wickedly|in|the earth|spreading corruption.
(What) remains|(from) Allah|(is) best|for you,|if|you are|believers.|And not|I am|over you|a guardian."
They said,|"O Shuaib |Does your prayer|command you|that|we leave|what|worship|our forefathers,|or|that|we do|concerning|our wealth|what|we will?|Indeed you,|surely you|(are) the forbearing,|the right-minded."
He said,|"O my people |Do you see|if|I am|on|a clear evidence|from|my Lord,|and He has provided me|from Himself|a good provision?||And not|I intend|that|I differ from you|in|what|I forbid you|from it.|Not|I intend|except|the reform|as much as I am able.||And not|(is) my success|except|with Allah.|Upon Him|I trust|and to Him|I turn.
And O my people |(Let) not cause you to sin||my dissension|lest|befalls you|similar|(to) what|befell|(the) people of Nuh||or|(the) people of Hud||or|people of Salih.||And not|(are the) people of Lut||from you|far off.
And ask forgiveness|(of) your Lord,|then|turn in repentance|to Him.|Indeed,|my Lord|(is) Most Merciful,|Most Loving."
They said,|"O Shuaib |Not|we understand|much|of what|you say,|and indeed, we|surely [we] see you|among us|weak.|And if not|for your family|surely we would have stoned you,|and you are not||against us|mighty."
He said,|"O my people |Is my family|mightier|on you|than|Allah?|And you have taken Him,|behind your|backs.|Indeed,|my Lord|of what|you do|(is) All-Encompassing.
And O my people |Work|(according) to|your position,|indeed, I am|working.|Soon|you will know|(on) whom|will come|a punishment|(that will) disgrace him ,|and who|[he]|(is) a liar.|And watch,|indeed, I am|with you|a watcher."
And when|came|Our Command,|We saved|Shuaib|and those who|believed|with him|by a Mercy|from Us.|And seized|those who|wronged,|the thunderous blast|then they became|in|their homes|fallen prone.
As if|not|they (had) prospered|therein.|So,|away|with Madyan|as|was taken away|the Thamud.
And certainly|We sent|Musa|with Our Signs|and an authority|clear,
To|Firaun|and his chiefs,|but they followed|(the) command of Firaun,||and not|(the) command of Firaun||was right.
He will precede|his people|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|and lead them|(into) the Fire.|And wretched|(is) the place|to which (they are) led.
And they were followed|in|this|(by) a curse|and (on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|Wretched|(is) the gift|which (will) be given.
That|(is) from|(the) news|(of) the cities|(which) We relate|to you;|of them,|some are standing|and (some) mown.
And not|We wronged them|but|they wronged|themselves.|So not|availed|them|their gods|which|they invoked|other than Allah,|||any|thing,|when|came|(the) command (of) your Lord.||And not|they increased them|other than|ruin.
And thus|(is) the seizure (of) your Lord||when|He seizes|the cities|while they|(are) doing wrong.|Indeed,|His seizure|(is) painful,|(and) severe.
Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a Sign|for (those) who|fear|(the) punishment|(of) the Hereafter.|That|(is) a Day|(will) be gathered|on it|the mankind,|and that|(is) a Day|witnessed.
And not|We delay it|except|for a term|limited.
(The) Day|(it) comes|not|will speak|a soul|except|by His leave.|Then among them|(will be the) wretched,|and (the) glad.
As for|those who|were wretched|then (they will be) in|the Fire.|For them|therein|(is) sighing,|and wailing.
(Will be) abiding|therein|as long as remain||the heavens|and the earth,|except|what your Lord wills.|||Indeed,|your Lord|(is) All-Accomplisher|of what|He intends.
And as for|those who|were glad|then (they will be) in|Paradise,|(will be) abiding|therein|as long as remains||the heavens|and the earth,|except|what your Lord wills -|||a bestowal|not|interrupted.
So (do) not|be|in|doubt|as to what|worship|these (polytheists).|Not|they worship|except|as what|worshipped|their forefathers|before.||And indeed, We|will surely pay them in full|their share|without|being diminished.
And verily|We gave|Musa|the Book,|but differences arose|therein.|And if not|(for) a Word|(that) preceded|from|your Lord,|surely would have been judged|between them.|And indeed, they|surely (are) in|doubt|concerning it|suspicious.
And indeed,|to each [when]||surely will pay them in full|your Lord|their deeds.|Indeed, He|of what|they do|(is) All-Aware.
So stand firm|as|you are commanded|and (those) who|turn (in repentance)|with you,|and (do) not|transgress.|Indeed, He|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
And (do) not|incline|to|those who|do wrong|lest touches you|the Fire,|and not|(is) for you|besides Allah|||any|protectors;|then|not|you will be helped.
And establish|the prayer|(at the) two ends|(of) the day|and (at) the approach|of|the night.|Indeed,|the good deeds|remove|the evil deeds.|That|(is) a reminder|for those who remember.
And be patient,|for indeed,|Allah|(does) not|let go waste|(the) reward|(of) the good-doers.
So why not|had been|of|the generations|before you||those possessing a remnant,||forbidding|from|the corruption|in|the earth|except|a few|of those|We saved|among them?|But followed|those who|did wrong|what|luxury they were given|therein,|and they were|criminals.
And not|would|your Lord,|destroy|the cities|unjustly|while its people|(were) reformers.
And if|your Lord (had) willed||surely He (could) have made|the mankind|one community,||but not|they will cease|to differ.
Except|(on) whom|your Lord has bestowed Mercy,||and for that|He created them.|And will be fulfilled|(the) Word of your Lord,||"Surely I will fill|Hell|with|the Jinn|and the men|all together."
And each,|We relate|to you|of|(the) news|(of) the Messengers|(for) that|We may make firm|with it|your heart.|And has come to you|in|this|the truth|and an admonition|and a reminder|for the believers.
And say|to those who|(do) not|believe,|"Work|(according) to|your position;|indeed, we|(are also) working.
And wait;|indeed, we|(are) ones who wait."
And for Allah|(is the) unseen|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and to Him|will be returned|the matter,|all (of) it,|so worship Him,|and put your trust|upon Him.|And your Lord is not||unaware|of what|you do.
Alif Laam Ra.|These|(are the) Verses|(of) the Book|[the] clear.
Indeed, We,|We have sent it down,|(as) a Quran in Arabic||so that you may|understand.
We|relate|to you|(the) best|(of) the narrations|in what|We have revealed|to you|(of) this|the Quran,|although|you were,|before it,||surely among|the unaware.
When|said|Yusuf|to his father,|"O my father |Indeed, I|I saw|eleven||star(s)|and the sun|and the moon;|I saw them|to me|prostrating."
He said,|"O my son |(Do) not|relate|your vision|to|your brothers|lest they plan|against you|a plot.|Indeed,|the Shaitaan|(is) to man|an enemy|open.
And thus|will choose you|your Lord|and will teach you|of|(the) interpretation|(of) the narratives|and complete|His Favor|on you|and on|(the) family|(of) Yaqub|as|He completed it|on|your two forefathers|before -||Ibrahim|and Ishaq.|Indeed,|your Lord|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise."
Certainly|were|in|Yusuf|and his brothers|signs|for those who ask.
When|they said,|"Surely Yusuf|and his brother|(are) more beloved|to|our father|than we,|while we|(are) a group.|Indeed,|our father|(is) surely in|an error|clear.
Kill|Yusuf|or|cast him|(to) a land|so will be free|for you|(the) face|(of) your father,|and you will be|after that||a people|righteous."
Said|a speaker|among them,|"(Do) not|kill|Yusuf|but throw him|in|the bottom|(of) the well,|will pick him|some|[the] caravan|if|you are|doing."
They said,|"O our father |Why|(do) you|not|trust us|with|Yusuf,|while indeed, we|(are) for him|surely well-wishers?
Send him|with us|tomorrow,|(to) enjoy|and play.|And indeed, we|will surely be his guardians."|
He said,|"Indeed, [I]|it surely saddens me|that|you should take him||and I fear|that|would eat him|a wolf|while you|of him|(are) unaware."
They said,|"If|eats him|the wolf|while we|(are) a group,|indeed, we|then|surely (would be) losers."
So when|they took him||and agreed|that|they put him|in|(the) bottom|(of) the well.|But We inspired|to him,|"Surely, you will inform them|about this affair,||while they|(do) not|perceive."
And they came|(to) their father|early at night|weeping.
They said,|"O our father |Indeed, we|[we] went|racing each other|and we left|Yusuf|with|our possessions,|and ate him|the wolf.|But not|you|(will) believe|us,|even if|we are|truthful."
And they brought|upon|his shirt|with false blood.||He said,|"Nay,|has enticed you||your souls|(to) a matter,|so patience|(is) beautiful.|And Allah|(is) the One sought for help|against|what|you describe."
And there came|a caravan|and they sent|their water drawer|then he let down|his bucket.|He said,|"O good news |This|(is) a boy."|And they hid him|(as) a merchandise.|And Allah|(is) All- Knower|of what|they do.
And they sold him|for a price|very low,|dirhams|few,|and they were|about him|of|those keen to give up.
And said|the one who|bought him|of|Egypt|to his wife,|"Make comfortable|his stay.|Perhaps|that|(he) will benefit us|or|we will take him|(as) a son."|And thus|We established|Yusuf|in|the land|that We might teach him|(the) interpretation of||the events.|And Allah|(is) Predominant|over|His affairs,|but|most|(of) the people|(do) not|know.
And when|he reached|his maturity,|We gave him|wisdom|and knowledge.|And thus|We reward|the good-doers.
And sought to seduce him|she who,|he (was)|in|her house|from|his self.|And she closed|the doors|and she said,|"Come on|you."|He said,|"I seek refuge in Allah.||Indeed, he|(is) my lord|(who has) made good|my stay.|Indeed,|not|will succeed|the wrongdoers."
And certainly|she did desire|him,|and he would have desired|her,|if not|that|he saw|the proof|(of) his Lord.|Thus,|that We might avert|from him|the evil|and the immorality.|Indeed, he|(was) of|Our slaves|the sincere.
And they both raced|(to) the door|and she tore|his shirt|from|the back,|and they both found|her husband|at|the door.|She said,|"What|(is) the recompense|(of one) who|intended|for your wife|evil|except|that|he be imprisoned|or|a punishment|painful?"
He said,|"She|sought to seduce me|about|myself."|And testified|a witness|of|her family|"If|[is]|his shirt|(is) torn|from|the front|then she has spoken the truth,|and he|(is) of|the liars.
But if|[is]|his shirt|(is) torn|from|(the) back|then she has lied|and he|(is) of|the truthful."
So when|he saw|his shirt|torn|from|(the) back|he said,|"Indeed, it|(is) of|your plot.|Indeed,|your plot|(is) great.
Yusuf,|turn away|from|this.|And ask forgiveness|for your sin.|Indeed, you|are|of|the sinful."
And said|women|in|the city,|"The wife of|Aziz|(is) seeking to seduce|her slave boy|about|himself;|indeed,|he has impassioned her|(with) love.|Indeed, we|[we] surely see her|in|an error|clear."
So when|she heard|of their scheming,|she sent|for them|and she prepared|for them|a banquet|and she gave|each|one|of them|a knife|and she said,|"Come out|before them."|Then when|they saw him|they greatly admired him,|and cut|their hands,|they said,|"Forbid|Allah,|not|(is) this|a man|not|(is) this|but|an angel|noble."
She said,|"That|(is) the one,|you blamed me|about him.|And certainly|I sought to seduce him,|[from]|[himself]|but he saved himself,|and if|not|he does|what|I order him,|surely, he will be imprisoned|and certainly will be|of|those who are disgraced."
He said,|"My Lord,|the prison|(is) dearer|to me|than what|they invite me|to it.|And unless|You turn away|from me|their plot|I might incline|towards them|and [I] be|of|the ignorant."
So responded|to him|his Lord,|and turned away|from him|their plot.|Indeed, [He]|He|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Knower.
Then|(it) appeared|to them|after||[what]|they had seen|the signs,|surely they should imprison him|until|a time.
And entered|with him|(in) the prison|two young men.|Said|one of them,|"Indeed, I|[I] see myself|pressing|wine."|And said|the other,|"Indeed, I|[I] see myself|[I am] carrying|over|my head|bread,|(were) eating|the birds|from it.|Inform us|of its interpretation;|indeed, we|[we] see you|of|the good-doers."
He said,|"Not|(will) come to both of you|food|you are provided with|but|I will inform both of you|of its interpretation,|before|[that]|[it] comes to both of you.|That|(is) of what|has taught me|my Lord.|Indeed, I|[I] abandon|(the) religion|(of) a people,|not|they believe|in Allah,|and they|in the Hereafter|[they]|(are) disbelievers.
And I follow|(the) religion|(of) my forefathers,|Ibrahim,|and Ishaq|and Yaqub.|Not|was|for us|that|we associate|with Allah|any|thing.|That|(is) from|(the) Grace|(of) Allah|upon us,|and upon|the mankind|but|most|(of) the men|(are) not|grateful.
O my two companions|(of) the prison |Are lords|separate|better|or|Allah,|the One|the Irresistible?
Not|you worship|besides Him||but|names|which you have named them,|you|and your forefathers,|not|(has) sent down|Allah|for it|any|authority.|Not|(is) the command|but|for Allah.|He has commanded|that not|you worship|but|Him Alone.|That|(is) the religion|the right,|but|most|[the] men|(do) not|know.
O my two companions|(of) the prison |As for|one of you|he will give drink|(to) his master|wine;|and as for|the other|he will be crucified,|and will eat|the birds|from|his head.|Has been decreed|the matter|about which||you both inquire."
And he said|to the one whom|he thought|that he|(would be) saved|of both of them,|"Mention me|to|your master."|But made him forget|the Shaitaan|(the) mention|(to) his master,|so he remained|in|the prison|several|years.
And said|the king,|"Indeed, I|[I] have seen|seven|cows|fat,|eating them|seven|lean ones,|and seven|ears (of corn)|green,|and other|dry.|O|chiefs |Explain to me|about|my vision|if|you can|of visions|interpret."
They said,|"Confused|dreams,|and not|we|(are) in the interpretation|(of) the dreams|learned."
But said|the one who|was saved|of the two|and remembered|after|a period,|"I|[I] will inform you|of its interpretation|so send me forth.
Yusuf,|O|the truthful one |Explain to us|about|(the) seven|cows|fat|eating them|seven|lean ones,|and seven|ears (of corn)|green|and other|dry,|that I may|return|to|the people|so that they may|know."
He said,|"You will sow|(for) seven|years,|as usual,|and that which|you reap|so leave it|in|its ears|except|a little|from which|you (will) eat.
Then|will come|after||that|seven|hard (years)|(which will) consume|what|you advanced|for them,|except|a little|of what|you (will) store.
Then|will come|after||that|a year|in it|will be given abundant rain|the people|and in it|they will press."
And said|the king,|"Bring him to me."||But when|came to him|the messenger,|he said,|"Return|to|your lord,|and ask him|what|(is the) case|(of) the women|who|cut|their hands.|Indeed,|my Lord|of their plot|(is) All-Knower."
He said,|"What|(was) your affair|when|you sought to seduce|Yusuf|from|himself?"|They said,|"Allah forbid ||Not|we know|about him|any|evil."|Said|(the) wife|(of) Aziz,|"Now|(is) manifest|the truth.|I|sought to seduce him|from|himself,|and indeed, he|(is) surely of|the truthful.
That|he may know|that I|not|[I] betray him|in secret,|and that|Allah|(does) not|guide|(the) plan|(of) the betrayers."
"And not|I absolve|myself.|Indeed,|the soul|(is) a certain enjoiner|of evil,|unless|[that]|bestows Mercy|my Lord.|Indeed,|my Lord|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful."
And said|the king,|"Bring him to me;||I will select him|for myself."|Then when|he spoke to him,|he said,|"Indeed, you|(are) today|with us|firmly established|(and) trusted."
He said,|"Appoint me|over|(the) treasuries|(of) the land.|Indeed, I|(will be) a guardian|knowing."
And thus|We established|[to] Yusuf|in|the land|to settle|therein|where ever|he willed.|We bestow|Our Mercy|(on) whom|We will.|And not|We let go waste|(the) reward|(of) the good-doers.
And surely (the) reward|(of) the Hereafter|(is) better|for those who|believe|and are|God conscious.
And came|(the) brothers|(of) Yusuf|and they entered|upon him;|and he recognized them,|but they|knew him not.|
And when|he had furnished them|with their supplies,|he said,|"Bring to me|a brother|of yours,|from|your father.|Do not|you see|that I|[I] give full|[the] measure,|and that I am|(the) best|(of) the hosts?
But if|not|you bring him to me||then (there will be) no|measure|for you|from me,|and not|you will come near me."
They said,|"We will try to get permission|for him|(from) his father,|and indeed we,|surely will do."
And he said|to his servants,|"Put|their merchandise|in|their saddlebags|so that they|may recognize it|when|they go back|to|their people|so that they may|return."
So when|they returned|to|their father,|they said,|"O our father |Has been denied|to us|the measure,|so send|with us|our brother|(that) we will get measure.|And indeed, we|for him|(will) surely (be) guardians."
He said,|"Should|I entrust you|with him|except|as|I  entrusted you|with|his brother|before?||But Allah|(is) the best|Guardian|and He|(is the) Most Merciful|(of) the merciful."
And when|they opened|their baggage,|they found|their merchandise|returned|to them.|They said,|"O our father |What|(could) we desire?|This|(is) our merchandise|returned|to us.|And we will get provision|(for) our family,|and we will protect|our brother|and get an increase|measure|(of) a camel's (load).|That|(is) a measurement|easy."
He said,|"Never|will I send him|with you|until|you give to me|a promise|by|Allah|that surely you will bring him to me||unless|that|you are surrounded."||And when|they had given him|their promise,|he said,|"Allah|over|what|we say|(is) a Guardian."
And he said,|"O my sons |(Do) not|enter|from|one gate,||but enter|from|gates|different.|And not|I can avail|you|against|Allah|any|thing.|Not|(is) the decision|except|with Allah,|upon Him|I put my trust|and upon Him,|let put  (their) trust|the ones who put trust."
And when|they entered|from|where|ordered them|their father,|not|it|avail(ed)|them|against|Allah|any|thing|but|(it was) a need|of|Yaqub's soul,||which he carried out.|And indeed, he|(was) a possessor|(of) knowledge|because|We had taught him,|but|most|(of) the people|(do) not|know.
And when|they entered|upon|Yusuf,|he took|to himself|his brother.|He said,|"Indeed, I|[I] am|your brother|so (do) not|grieve|for what|they used (to)|do."
So when|he had furnished them|with their supplies,|he put|the drinking cup|in|the bag|(of) his brother.|Then|called out|an announcer|"O you|(in) the caravan |Indeed, you|surely (are) thieves."
They said|turning towards|them,|"What (is it)|you miss?"
They said,|"We are missing|(the) cup|(of) the king.|And for (one) who|brings|it,|(is) a load|(of) a camel,|and I (am)|for it|responsible."
They said,|"By Allah|certainly|you know|not|we came|that we cause corruption|in|the land,|and not|we are|thieves."
They said,|"Then what|(will be the) recompense  (of) it|if|you are|liars."
They said,|"Its recompense|(is that one) who,|it is found|in|his bag,|then he|(will be) his recompense.|Thus|(do) we recompense|the wrongdoers."
So he began|with their bags|before|(the) bag|(of) his brother;|then|he brought it out|from|(the) bag|(of) his brother.|Thus|(did)  We plan|for Yusuf.|He could not||take|his brother|by|the law|(of) the king,|except|that|Allah willed.||We raise|(in) degrees|whom|We will,|but over|every|possessor|(of) knowledge|(is) the All-Knower.
They said,|"If|he steals -|then verily|stole|a brother|of his|before."||But Yusuf kept it secret||within|himself,|and (did) not|reveal it|to them.|He said,|"You|(are the) worse|(in) position,|and Allah|knows best|of what|you describe."
They said,|"O|Aziz |Indeed,|he has|a father|old|[great],|so take|one of us|(in) his place.|Indeed, we|[we] see you|of|the good-doers."
He said,|"Allah forbid||that|we take|except|(one) who,|we found|our possession|with him.|Indeed, we|then|surely (would be) wrongdoers."
So when|they despaired|of him,|they secluded themselves|(in) private consultation.|Said|the eldest among them,|"Do not|you know|that|your father,|has taken||upon you|a promise|by|Allah,|and before||that|you failed|concerning|Yusuf?|So never|will I leave|the land|until|permits|me|my father|or|Allah decides||for me,|and He|(is) the Best|(of) the judges.
Return|to|your father|and say,|"O our father |Indeed,|your son|has stolen,|and not|we testify|except|of what|we knew.|And not|we were|of the unseen|guardians.
And ask|the town|where|we were|[in it],|and the caravan|which|we returned|[in it].|And indeed, we|surely (are) truthful."
He said,|"Nay,|have enticed|you|your souls|something,|so patience|(is) beautiful.|Perhaps|Allah,|will bring them to me|||all.|Indeed, He|He|(is) the All-Knower,|All-Wise."
And he turned away|from them|and said,|"Alas, my grief|over|Yusuf "|And became white|his eyes|from|the grief,|and he (was)|a suppressor.
They said,|"By Allah,|you will not cease|remembering|Yusuf|until|you become|fatally ill|or|become|of|those who perish."
He said,|"Only|I complain|(of) my suffering|and my grief|to|Allah,|and I know|from|Allah|what|not|you know.
O my sons |Go|and inquire|about|Yusuf|and his brother,|and not|despair|of|(the) Mercy of Allah.||Indeed,|none|despairs|of|(the) Mercy of Allah||except|the people|the disbelievers."
So when|they entered|upon him|they said,|"O Aziz ||Has touched us|and our family|the adversity,|and we have come|with goods|(of) little value,|but pay (in) full|to us|the measure|and be charitable|to us.|Indeed,|Allah|rewards|the charitable."
He said,|"Do|you know|what|you did|with Yusuf|and his brother,|when|you were|ignorant?"
They said,|"Are you indeed,|[surely you],|Yusuf?"|He said,|"I am|Yusuf|and this|(is) my brother.|Indeed,|Allah has been gracious||to us.|Indeed, he|who|fears Allah|and (is) patient,|then indeed,|Allah|(does) not|let go waste|(the) reward|(of) the good-doers.
They said,|"By Allah,|certainly|Allah has preferred you||over us|and indeed,|we have been|sinners."
He said,|"No|blame|upon you|today.|Allah will forgive||you,|and He|(is) the Most Merciful|(of) those who show mercy.
Go|with this shirt of mine||and cast it|over|(the) face|(of) my father,|he will regain sight.||And bring to me|your family|all together."
And when|departed|the caravan,|their father said,||"Indeed, I|[I] find|(the) smell|(of) Yusuf,|if not|that|you think me weakened in mind."
They said,|"By Allah|indeed, you|surely (are) in|your error|old."
Then when|[that]|arrived|the bearer of glad tidings,|he cast it|over|his face,|then returned (his) sight.||He said,|"Did not|I say|to you,|indeed, I|[I] know|from|Allah|what|not|you know?"
They said,|"O our father |Ask forgiveness|for us|(of) our sins.|Indeed, we|have been|sinners."
He said,|"Soon|I will ask forgiveness|for you|(from) my Lord.|Indeed, He,|He|(is) the Oft-Forgiving,|the Most Merciful."
Then when|they entered|upon|Yusuf,|he took|to himself|his parents|and said,|"Enter|Egypt|if|Allah wills,||safe."
And he raised|his parents|upon|the throne|and they fell down|to him|prostrate.|And he said,|"O my father |This|(is the) interpretation|(of) my dream,|(of) before.||Verily,|has made it|my Lord|true.|And indeed,|He was good|to me|when|He took me out|of|the prison,|and brought|you|from|the bedouin life|after||[that]|had caused discord|the Shaitaan|between me|and between|my brothers.|Indeed,|my Lord|(is) Most Subtle|to what|He wills.|Indeed, He,|He|(is) the All-Knower,|the All-Wise.
My Lord,|indeed,|you have given on me|of|the sovereignty|and taught me|of|the interpretation|of the events.|Creator|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|You|(are) my Protector,|in|the world|and the Hereafter.|Cause me to die|(as) a Muslim,|and join me|with the righteous."
That|(is) from|the news|(of) the unseen|which We reveal|to you.|And not|you were|with them|when|they put together|their plan|while they|(were) plotting.
And not|most|(of) the mankind,|even though|you desire,|(will be) believers.
And not|you ask them|for it|any|reward.|Not|(is) it|but|a reminder|to the worlds.
And how many|of|a Sign|in|the heavens|and the earth|they pass|over it,|while they|(are) from them|the ones who turn away.
And not|believe|most of them|in Allah|except|while they|associate partners with Him.
Do they then feel secure|(against) that|comes to them|an overwhelming|[of]|punishment|(of) Allah,|or|comes to them|the Hour|suddenly|while they|(do) not|perceive?
Say,|"This|(is) my way;|I invite|to|Allah,|with|insight,|I|and whoever|follows me.|And Glory be|(to) Allah|and not|I am|of|the polytheists."
And not|We sent|before you,||but|men|We revealed|to them|from (among)|(the) people|(of) the townships.|So have not|they traveled|in|the earth|and seen|how|was|(the) end|(of) those who|(were) before them?||And surely the home|(of) the Hereafter|(is) best|for those who|fear Allah.|Then will not|you use reason?
Until|when|gave up hope|the Messengers,|and thought|that they|certainly|were denied,|then came to them|Our help,|and was saved|whom|We willed.|And not|(can) be repelled|Our punishment|from|the people|(who are) criminals.
Verily,|(there) is|in|their stories|a lesson|for men|(of) understanding.|Not|(it) is|a narration|invented,|but|a confirmation|(of that) which|(was) before it||and a detailed explanation|(of) all|things,|and a guidance|and mercy|for a people|who believe.
Alif Laam Mim Ra.|These|(are the) Verses|(of) the Book.|And that which|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord|(is) the truth,|but|most|(of) the mankind|(do) not|believe.
Allah|(is) the One Who|raised|the heavens|without|pillars|that you see,|then|He established|on|the Throne|and subjected|the sun|and the moon|each|running|for a term|appointed,|He arranges|the matter;|He details|the Signs|so that you may|in the meeting|(with) your Lord|believe with certainty.
And He|(is) the One Who|spread|the earth,|and placed|in it|firm mountains|and rivers,|and from|all|(of) the fruits|He made|in it|pairs|two.|He covers|the night|(with) the day.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who ponder.
And in|the earth|are tracks|neighboring,|and gardens|of|grapevines|and crops|and date-palms|trees (growing) from a single root|and trees not (growing) from a single root.||watered|with one water;||but We cause to exceed|some of them|over|others|in|the fruit.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who use reason.
And if|you (are) astonished,|then astonishing|(is) their saying,|"When|we are|dust,|will we|(be) indeed, in|a creation|new?"|Those|(are) the ones who|disbelieved|in their Lord,|and those|the iron chains|(will be) in|their necks,|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire,|they|in it|(will) abide forever.
And they ask you to hasten|the evil|before|the good|and verily|has occurred|before them||[the] similar punishments.|And indeed,|your Lord|(is) Full of Forgiveness||for mankind|for|their wrongdoing,|and indeed,|your Lord|(is) severe|(in) the penalty.
And say|those who|disbelieved,|"Why not|has been sent down|to him|a sign|from|his Lord?"|Only|you|(are) a warner,|and for every|people|(is) a guide.
Allah|knows|what|carries|every|female,|and what|fall short|the womb,|and what|they exceed.|And every|thing|with Him|(is) in due proportion.
Knower|(of) the unseen|and the witnessed,|the Most Great,|the Most High.
(It is) same (to Him)|[of you]|(one) who|conceals|the speech|or (one) who|publicizes it||and (one) who|[he]|(is) hidden|by night|or goes freely|by day.
For him|(are) successive (Angels)||before him||and behind him,||who guard him|by|(the) Command of Allah.||Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|change|the condition of a people,||until|they change|what|(is) in themselves.|And when|Allah wills||for a people|misfortune,|then (there is) no|turning away|of it,|and not|for them||besides Him|any|protector.
He|(is) the One Who|shows you|the lightning,|a fear|and a hope|and brings up|the heavy clouds.|
And glorifies|the thunder|[with] His praise|and the Angels|for|fear of Him.|And He sends|the thunderbolts|and strikes|with it|whom|He wills,|yet they|dispute|about|Allah.|And He|(is) Mighty|(in) Strength.
To Him|(is) supplication|(of) the truth.|And those whom|they invoke|besides Him||not|they respond|to them|with a thing|except|like one who stretches|his hands|towards|water|to reach|his mouth,|but not|it|reaches it.|And not|(is) the supplication|(of) the disbelievers|but|in|error.
And to Allah|prostrates|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth,|willingly|or unwillingly,|and (so do) their shadows|in the mornings|and in the afternoons.
Say,|"Who|(is) the Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth?"|Say,|"Allah."|Say,|"Have you then taken||besides Him,|protectors,|not|they have power|for themselves|(to) benefit|and not|(to) harm?"|Say,|"Is|equal|the blind|and the seeing?|Or|is|equal|the darkness[es]|and the light?|Or|they attribute|to Allah|partners|who created|like His creation,|so that seemed alike|the creation|to them?"|Say,|"Allah|(is) the Creator|of all|things,|and He|(is) the One|the Irresistible."
He sends down|from|the sky|water|and flows|the valleys|according to their measure,|and carries|the torrent|a foam|rising.|And from what|they heat|[on] it|in|the fire|in order to make|ornaments|or|utensils,|a foam|like it.|Thus|Allah sets forth||the truth|and the falsehood.|Then as for|the foam|it passes away|(as) scum,|and as for|what|benefits|the mankind,|remains|in|the earth.|Thus|Allah sets forth||the examples.
For those who|responded|to their Lord|(is) the bliss.|And for those who|(did) not|respond|to Him,|if|that|they had|whatever|(is) in|the earth|all|and like of it|with it,|surely they would offer ransom|with it.|Those|for them|(is) a terrible|reckoning,|and their abode|(is) Hell,|and wretched|(is) the resting place.
Then is (he) who|knows|that which|has been revealed|to you|from|your Lord|(is) the truth|like (one) who|[he]|is blind?|Only|pay heed|men|(of) understanding.
Those who|fulfill|the Covenant of Allah||and not|they break|the contract,
And those who|join|what|Allah has commanded||[for it]|to|be joined,|and fear|their Lord|and are afraid|(of) the evil|the account,
And those who|(are) patient,|seeking|(the) Face|(of) their Lord|and establish|the prayer|and spend|from what|We have provided them,|secretly|and publicly|and they repel|with the good|the evil -|those|for them|(is) the final attainment|(of) the Home -
Gardens|of Eden,|they will enter them|and whoever|(were) righteous|among|their fathers|and their spouses,|and their offsprings.|And the Angels|will enter|upon them|from|every|gate,
(Saying), "Peace|(be) upon you|for what|you patiently endured.|And excellent|(is) the final attainment|(of) the Home.
And those who|break|the Covenant of Allah||after||contracting it,|and sever|what|Allah has commanded||for it|to|be joined|and spread corruption|in|the earth.|Those  -|for them|(is) the curse,|and for them|(is) an evil|home.
Allah|extends|the provision|for whom|He wills|and restricts.|And they rejoice|in the life|(of) the world|and nothing|(is) the life|of the world|in (comparison to)|the Hereafter,|except|an enjoyment.
And say|those who|disbelieved,|"Why has not|been sent down|upon him|a Sign|from|his Lord?"|Say,|"Indeed,|Allah|lets go astray|whom|He wills|and guides|to Himself|whoever|turns back,
Those who|believed|and find satisfaction|their hearts|in the remembrance|(of) Allah.|No doubt,|in the remembrance of Allah||find satisfaction|the hearts.
Those who|believed|and did|righteous deeds,|blessedness|(is) for them|and a beautiful|place of return.
Thus|We have sent you|to|a nation|verily|have passed away|before it||nations,|so that you might recite|to them|what|We revealed|to you,|while they|disbelieve|in the Most Gracious.|Say,|"He|(is) my Lord,|(there is) no|god|except|Him.|Upon Him|I put my trust|and to Him|(is) my return."
And if|that was|any Quran,|could be moved|by it|the mountains,|or|could be cloven asunder|by it|the earth,|or|could be made to speak|by it|the dead.|Nay,|with Allah|(is) the command|all.|Then do not|know|those who|believe|that|if|Allah had willed||surely, He would have guided|all of the mankind?||And not|will cease|those who|disbelieve|to strike them|for what|they did|a disaster,|or|it settles|close|from|their homes|until|comes|(the) Promise of Allah.||Indeed,|Allah|(will) not|fail|(in) the Promise.
And certainly,|were mocked|Messengers||before you,|but I granted respite|to those who|disbelieved;|then|I seized them,|and how|was|My penalty.
Is then He Who||(is) a Maintainer|of|every|soul|for what|it has earned?|Yet they ascribe|to Allah|partners.|Say,|"Name them.|Or|(do) you inform Him|of what|not|He knows|in|the earth|or|of the apparent|of|the words?"|Nay,|(is) made fair-seeming|to those who|disbelieve|their plotting,|and they are hindered|from|the Path.|And whoever|Allah lets go astray||then not|for him|any|guide.
For them|(is) a punishment|in|the life|(of) the world|and surely the punishment|(of) the Hereafter|(is) harder.|And not|for them|against|Allah|any|defender.
The example|of Paradise|which|(is) promised|(to) the righteous,|flows|from|underneath it|the rivers.|Its food|(is) everlasting,|and its shade.|This|(is the) end|(of) those who|(are) righteous,|and (the) end|(of) the disbelievers|(is) the Fire.
And those (to) whom|We have given them|the Book,|rejoice|at what|has been revealed|to you,|but among|the groups|(those) who|deny|a part of it.|Say,|"Only|I have been commanded|that|I worship|Allah,|and not|I associate partners|with Him.|To Him|I call|and to Him|(is) my return."
And thus|We have revealed it|(to be) a judgment of authority|(in) Arabic.|And if|you follow|their desires|after what|came to you|of|the knowledge,|not|for you|against|Allah|any|protector|and not|defender.
And certainly,|We sent|Messengers||before you|and We made|for them|wives|and offspring.|And not|was|for a Messenger|that|he comes|with a sign|except|by the leave|(of) Allah.|For everything|(is) a time|prescribed.
Allah eliminates||what|He wills,|and confirms,|and with Him|(is) the Mother (of) the Book.|
And whether||We show you|a part|(of) what|We have promised them|or|We cause you to die,|so only|on you|(is) the conveyance,|and on Us|(is) the reckoning.
Did not|they see|that We|come|(to) the land,|reducing it|from|its borders?|And Allah|judges;|(there is) no|adjuster|(of) His Judgment.|And He|(is) Swift|(in) the reckoning.
And certainly|plotted|those who|(were) before them,||but for Allah|(is) the plot|all.|He knows|what|earns|every|soul,|and will know|the disbelievers|for whom|(is) the final|the home.
And say|those who|disbelieve,|"You are not|a Messenger."|Say,|"Sufficient|(is) Allah|(as) a Witness|between me|and between you,|and whoever|[he] has|knowledge|(of) the Book."
Alif Laam Ra.|A Book|which We have revealed|to you,|so that you may bring out|the mankind|from|the darkness[es]|to|the light|by the permission|(of) their Lord,|to|the Path|(of) the All-Mighty,|the Praiseworthy.
Allah|(is) the One|to Him (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And woe|to the disbelievers|from|the punishment|severe.
Those who|love more|the life|(of) the world|than|the Hereafter,|and hinder|from|(the) Path|(of) Allah,|and seek in it|crookedness,|those|[in]|(are) far astray.|
And not|We sent|any|Messenger|except|with the language|(of) his people|so that he might make clear|for them.|Then Allah lets go astray||whom|He wills|and guides|whom|He wills.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
And verily|We sent|Musa|with Our Signs,|that|"Bring out|your people|from|the darkness[es]|to|the light.|And remind them|of the days|(of) Allah."|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) the signs|for everyone|patient|and thankful.
And when|said|Musa|to his people,|"Remember|(the) Favor of Allah||upon you,|when|He saved you|from|(the) people|(of) Firaun,|they were afflicting you|(with) evil|torment|and were slaughtering|your sons|and letting live|your women.|And in|that|(was) a trial|from|your Lord|great.
And when|proclaimed|your Lord,|"If|you are thankful,|surely I will increase you;|but if|you are ungrateful|indeed,|My punishment|(is) surely severe.'"
And said|Musa,|"If|you disbelieve,|you|and whoever|(is) in|the earth|all,|then indeed,|Allah|certainly (is) Free of need,|Praiseworthy."
Has not|come to you|(the) news|(of) those who|(were) before you,||the people|of Nuh,|and Aad|and Thamud|and those who|(were) after them?||None|knows them|except|Allah.|Came to them|their Messengers|with clear proofs|but they returned|their hands|in|their mouths|and they said,|"Indeed we|[we] disbelieve|in what|you have been sent|with [it],|and indeed, we|(are) surely in|doubt|about what|you invite us|to it|suspicious."
Said|their Messengers,|"Can (there) be about|Allah|any doubt,|(the) Creator|(of) the heavens|and the earth?|He invites you,|so that He may forgive|for you|[of]|your sins,|and give you respite|for|a term|appointed."|They said,|"Not|you|(are) but|a human|like us,|you wish|to|hinder us|from what|used to|worship|our forefathers.|So bring us|an authority|clear."
Said|to them|their Messengers,|"Not|we (are)|but|a human|like you,|but|Allah|bestows His Grace|on|whom|He wills|of|His slaves.|And not|is|for us|that|we bring you|an authority|except|by the permission of Allah.||And upon|Allah|so let put (their) trust|the believers.
And what|(is) for us|that not|we put our trust|upon|Allah,|while certainly|He has guided us|to our ways?|And surely we will bear with patience|on|what|harm you may cause us.|And upon|Allah|so let put (their) trust|the ones who put (their) trust."
And said|those who|disbelieved|to their Messengers,|"Surely we will drive you out|of|our land|or|surely you should return|to|our religion."|So inspired|to them|their Lord,|"We will surely destroy|the wrongdoers.
And surely We will make you dwell|(in) the land|after them.||That|(is) for whoever|fears|standing before Me|and fears|My Threat."
And they sought victory|and disappointed|every|tyrant|obstinate.
Ahead of him||(is) Hell,|and he will be made to drink|of|water|purulent.
He will sip it|but not|he will be near|(to) swallowing it.|And will come to him|the death|from|every|side,|but not|he|will die.|And ahead of  him||(is) a punishment|harsh.
(The) example|(of) those who|disbelieve|in their Lord,|their deeds|(are) like ashes|blows furiously|on it|the wind|in|a day|stormy.|No|control (they have)|of what|they have earned|on|anything.|That,|[it]|(is) the straying|far.
Do not|you see,|that|Allah|created|the heavens|and the earth|in truth?|If|He wills,|He can remove you|and bring|new.|a creation
And not|(is) that|on|Allah|great.
And they will come forth|before Allah|all together,|then will say|the weak|to those who|were arrogant,|"Indeed we,|we were|your|followers,|so can|you (be)|the one who avails|us|from|(the) punishment|(of) Allah|anything?"||They will say,|"If|Allah had guided us||surely we would have guided you.|(It is) same|for us|whether we show intolerance|or|we are patient,|not|(is) for us|any|place of escape."
And will say|the Shaitaan,|when|has been decided|the matter,|"Indeed,|Allah|promised you|a promise|(of) truth.|And I promised you,|but I betrayed you.|But not|I had||over you|any|authority|except|that|I invited you,|and you responded|to me.|So (do) not|blame me,|but blame|yourselves.|Not|(can) I|(be) your helper|and not|you (can)|(be) my helper.|Indeed, I|deny|[of what]|your association  of me (with Allah)|before.||Indeed,|the wrongdoers,|for them|(is) a punishment|painful."
And will be admitted,|those who|believed|and did|righteous deeds|(to) Gardens|flows|from|underneath it|the rivers|(will) abide forever|in it|by the permission|(of) their Lord;|their greetings|therein|(will be) peace.
Do not|you see|how|Allah sets forth||the example,|a word|good|(is) like a tree|good,|its root|(is) firm|and its branches|(are) in|the sky?
Giving|its fruit|all|time|by the permission|of its Lord.|And Allah sets forth||the examples|for mankind|so that they may|remember.
And (the) example|(of) a word|evil|(is) like a tree|evil,|uprooted|from|the surface|(of) the earth,|not|for it|(is) any|stability.
Allah keeps firm||those who|believe|with the firm word||in|the life|(of) the world|and in|the Hereafter.|And Allah lets go astray||the wrongdoers.|And Allah does||what|He wills.
Have not|you seen|[to]|those who|(have) changed|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|(for) disbelief|and they led|their people|(to the) house|(of) destruction?
Hell,|(in) it they will burn|and a wretched|place to settle.
And they set up|to Allah|equals|so that they mislead|from|His Path.|Say,|"Enjoy,|but indeed,|your destination|(is) to|the Fire."
Say|to My slaves|those who|believe|(to) establish|the prayers,|and (to) spend|from what|We have provided them,|secretly|and publicly,|before||[that]|comes|a Day|not|any trade|in it|and not|any friendship.
Allah|(is) the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth,|and sent down|from|the sky|water,|then brought forth|from it|of|the fruits|(as) a provision|for you,|and subjected|for you|the ships,|so that they may sail|in|the sea|by His command,|and subjected|for you|the rivers.
And He subjected|for you|the sun|and the moon,|both constantly pursuing their courses,|and subjected|for you|the night|and the day.
And He gave you|of|all|what|you asked of Him.|And if|you count|(the) Favor of Allah||not|you will (be able to) count them.|Indeed,|the mankind|(is) surely unjust|(and) ungrateful.
And when|said|Ibrahim,|"My Lord |Make|this|city|safe,|and keep me away|and my sons|that|we worship|the idols.
My Lord |Indeed, they|have led astray|many|among|the mankind.|So whoever|follows me|then indeed, he|(is) of me,|and whoever|disobeys me,|then indeed, You|(are) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Our Lord |Indeed, I|[I] have settled|(some) of|my offsprings|in a valley|not|with|cultivation|near|Your Sacred House,||our Lord |That they may establish|the prayers.|So make|hearts|of|the men|incline|towards them,|and provide them|with|the fruits|so that they may|be grateful.
Our Lord |Indeed, You|You know|what|we conceal|and what|we proclaim.|And not|(is) hidden|from|Allah|any|thing|in|the earth|and not|in|the heaven.
All the Praise|(is) for Allah|the One Who|has granted|me|in|the old age|Ismail|and Ishaq.|Indeed,|my Lord|(is) All-Hearer|(of) the prayer.
My Lord |Make me|an establisher|(of) the prayer,|and from|my offsprings.|Our Lord |and accept|my prayer.
Our Lord |Forgive|me|and my parents|and the believers|(on) the Day|will (be) established|the account."
And (do) not|think|(that) Allah|(is) unaware|of what|do|the wrongdoers.|Only|He gives them respite|to a Day|will stare|in it|the eyes.
Racing ahead,|raised up|their heads,|not|returning|towards them|their gaze,|and their hearts|(are) empty.
And warn|the mankind|(of) a Day|(when) will come to them|the punishment,|then will say|those who|did wrong,|"Our Lord |Respite us|for|a term|short;|we will answer|Your call|and we will follow|the Messengers."|"Had not|you|sworn|before||not|for you|any|end?
And you dwelt|in|the dwellings|(of) those who|wronged|themselves,|and it had become clear|to you|how|We dealt|with them,|and We put forth|for you|the examples."
And indeed|they planned|their plan,|but with|Allah|(was) their plan,|even if|was|their plan|that should be moved|by it|the mountains.
So (do) not|think|(that) Allah|will fail|(to) keep His Promise|(to) His Messengers.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|Owner (of) Retribution.|
(On the) Day|will be changed|the earth|(to) other (than)|the earth,|and the heavens,|and they will come forth|before Allah,|the One,|the Irresistible.
And you will see|the criminals,|(on) that Day|bound together|in|the chains,
Their garments|of|tar,|and will cover|their faces|the Fire.
So that Allah may recompense||each|soul|(for) what|it earned.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Swift|(in) the reckoning.
This|(is) a Message|for the mankind,|that they may be warned|with it,|and that they may know|that only|He|(is) One God,||and that may take heed|men|(of) understanding.
Alif Laam Ra.|These|(are the) Verses|(of) the Book|and Quran|clear.
Perhaps|will wish|those who|disbelieved,|if|they had been|Muslims.
Leave them|(to) eat|and enjoy|and diverted them|the hope,|then soon|they will come to know.
And not|We destroyed|any|town|but|(there was) for it|a decree|known.
Not|(can) advance|any|nation|its term|and not|(can) delay it.
And they say,|"O you|(to) whom|has been sent down|[on him]|the Reminder,|indeed, you|(are) surely mad.
Why|not|you bring to us|the Angels,|if|you are|of|the truthful?"
Not|We send down|the Angels|except|with the truth;|and not|they would be|then|given respite.
Indeed, We|We|have sent down|the Reminder,|and indeed, We|of it|(are) surely Guardian.
And certainly|We (had) sent|before you||in|(the) sects|(of) the former (people).
And not|came to them|any|Messenger|but|they did|at him|mock.
Thus|We let it enter|in|(the) hearts|(of) the criminals.
Not|they believe|in it,|and verily|have passed|the way(s)|(of) the former (people).
And (even) if|We opened|to them|a gate|from|the heaven,|and they were to continue|therein|(to) ascend,
They would surely say|"Only|have been dazzled|our eyes.|Nay,|we|(are) a people|bewitched."
And verily|We have placed|in|the heavens|constellations|and We have beautified it|for the observers.
And We have protected it|from|every|devil|accursed.
Except|(one) who|steals|the hearing,|then follows him|a burning flame|clear.
And the earth,|We have spread it|and [We] cast|therein|firm mountains|and [We] caused to grow|therein|of|every|thing|well-balanced.
And We have made|for you|therein|means of living|and whom|you are not|for him|providers.
And not|(is) any|thing|but|with Us|(are) its treasures,|and not|We send it down|except|in a measure|known.
And We have sent|the winds|fertilizing,|and  We sent down|from|the sky|water,|and We gave it to you to drink.|And not|you|of it|(are) retainers.
And indeed, We,|surely [We]|We give life|and  We cause death,|and We|(are) the Inheritors.
And verily|We know|the preceding ones|among you|and verily,|We know|the later ones.
And indeed,|your Lord,|He|will gather them.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Wise,|All-Knowing.
And verily,|We created|humankind|(out) of|sounding clay|from|black mud|altered.
And the jinn|We created it|before||from|fire|scorching.
And when|your Lord said||to the Angels,|"Indeed, I|(will) create|a human being|(out) of|clay|from|black mud|altered.
So, when|I have fashioned him|and [I] breathed|into him|of|My spirit,|then fall down|to him|prostrating."
So prostrated|the Angels|all of them|together,
Except|Iblis.|He refused|to|be|with|those who prostrated.
He said,|"O Iblis |What|(is) for you|that not|you are|with|those who prostrated?"
He said,|"I am not||(one) to prostrate|to a human|whom You created,|(out) of|clay|from|black mud|altered."
He said,|"Then get out|of it,|for indeed, you|(are) expelled.
And indeed,|upon you|(will be) the curse|till|(the) Day|(of) [the] Judgment."
He said,|"O my Lord |Then give me respite|till|(the) Day|they are raised."
He said,|"Then indeed you,|(are) of|the ones given respite.
Till|the Day|(of) the time|well-known."
He said,|"My Lord |Because|You misled me,|surely, I will make (evil) fair-seeming|to them|in|the earth|and I will mislead them|all
Except,|Your slaves|among them|the ones who are sincere."
He said,|"This|(is) the way|to Me|straight.
Indeed,|My slaves,|not|you have|over them|any authority,|except|those who|follow you,|of|the ones who go astray."
And indeed,|Hell|(is) surely the promised place  for them|all.
For it|(are) seven|gates,|for each|gate|among them|(is) a portion|assigned.
Indeed,|the righteous|(will be) in|Gardens|and water springs.
"Enter it|in peace,|secure."
And We (will) remove|what|(is) in|their breasts|of|rancor|(they will be) brothers|on|thrones|facing each other.
Not|will touch them|therein|fatigue,|and not|they|from it|will be removed.
Inform|My slaves|that I,|I am|the Oft-Forgiving,|the Most Merciful.
And that|My punishment,|it|(is) the punishment|the most painful.
And inform them|about|(the) guests|(of) Ibrahim,
When|they entered|upon him|and said,|"Peace."|He said,|"Indeed, we|(are) of you|afraid."
They said,|"(Do) not|be afraid,|indeed, we|[we] bring glad tidings to you|of a boy|learned."
He said,|"Do you give me glad tidings|although||has overtaken me|old age?|Then about what|you give glad tidings?"
They said,|"We give you glad tidings|in truth,|so (do) not|be|of|the despairing."
He said,|"And who|despairs|of|(the) Mercy|(of) his Lord|except|those who are astray."
He said,|"Then what|(is) your business,|O messengers?"|
They said,|"Indeed, we|[we] have been sent|to|a people -|criminals,
Except|the family|of Lut;|indeed, we|surely will save them|all
Except|his wife."|We have decreed|that she|(is) surely of|those who remain behind.
And when|came|(to the) family|(of) Lut|the messengers,
He said,|"Indeed, you|(are) a people|unknown."
They said,|"Nay,|we have come to you|with what|they were|in it|disputing,
And we have come to you|with the truth,|and indeed, we|surely (are) truthful.
So travel|with your family|in a portion|of|the night|and follow|their backs,|and not|let look back|among you|anyone,|and go on|where|you are ordered."
And We conveyed|to him|[that]|the matter|that|(the) root|(of) these|would be cut off|(by) early morning.
And came|(the) people|(of) the city,|rejoicing.
He said,|"Indeed,|these|(are) my guests,|so (do) not|shame me.
And fear|Allah,|and (do) not|disgrace me."
They said,|"Did not|we forbid you|from|the world?"
He said,|"These|(are) my daughters|if|you would be|doers."
By your life|indeed, they|were in|their intoxication,|wandering blindly.
So, seized them|the awful cry|at sunrise.
And We made|its highest (part)|its lowest,|and We rained|upon them|stones|of|baked clay.
Indeed,|in|that|(are) the Signs|for those who discern.
And indeed, it|(is) on a road|established.
Indeed,|in|that|surely (is) a Sign|for the believers.
And were||(the) companions|(of) the wood|surely wrongdoers.
So We took retribution|from them,|and indeed, they both|(were) on a highway|clear.
And certainly|denied|(the) companions|(of) the Rocky Tract,|the Messengers.
And We gave them|Our Signs,|but they were|from them|turning away.
And they used (to)|carve|from|the mountains,|houses,|secure.
But seized them|the awful cry|(at) early morning,
And not|availed|them|what|they used (to)|earn.
And not|We created|the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them|except|in truth.|And indeed,|the Hour|(is) surely coming.|So overlook|(with) forgiveness|gracious.
Indeed,|your Lord,|He|(is) the Creator|the All-Knower.
And certainly,|We have given you|seven|of|the oft-repeated|and the Quran|Great.
(Do) not|extend|your eyes|towards|what|We have bestowed|with it|(to) categories|of them|and (do) not|grieve|over them.|And lower|your wing|to the believers.
And say,|"Indeed, I|[I] am|a warner|clear."
As|We sent down|on|those who divided.
Those who|have made|the Quran|(in) parts.
So by your Lord,|surely We will question them|all
About what|they used (to)|do.
So proclaim|of what|you are ordered|and turn away|from|the polytheists.
Indeed, We|[We] are sufficient for you|(against) the mockers
Those who|set up|with|Allah|god|another.|But soon|they will come to know.
And verily,|We know|that [you]|(is) straitened|your breast|by what|they say.
So glorify|with the praise|(of) your Lord|and be|of|those who prostrate.
And worship|your Lord|until|comes to you|the certainty.
Will come|(the) command of Allah||so (do) not|(be) impatient for it.|Glorified is He|and Exalted (is) He|above what|they associate.
He sends down|the Angels|with the inspiration|of|His Command,|upon|whom|He wills|of|His slaves,|that|"Warn|that [He]|(there is) no|god|except|Me,|so fear Me."
He created|the heavens|and the earth,|in truth.|Exalted is He|above what|they associate.
He created|the human kind|from|a minute quantity of semen,|then behold,|he|(is) an opponent|clear.
And the cattle,|He created them|for you,|in them|(is) warmth|and benefits|and from them|you eat.
And for you|in them|(is) beauty|when|you bring them in|and when|you take them out.
And they carry|your loads|to|a land|not|you could|reach it|except|with great trouble|(to) yourselves.|Indeed,|your Lord|surely is Most Kind,|Most Merciful.
And horses|and mules|and donkeys|for you to ride them|and (as) adornment.|And He creates|what|not|you know.
And upon|Allah|(is) the direction|(of) the way,|and among them|(are) crooked.|And if|He willed,|surely He would have guided you|all.
He|(is) the One Who|sends down|from|the sky|water|for you|of it|(is) drink,|and from it|(grows) vegetation|in which|you pasture your cattle.
He causes to grow|for you|with it,|the crops|and the olives|and the date-palms|and the grapes|and of|every kind|(of) fruits.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (is) a sign|for a people|who reflect.
And He has subjected|for you|the night|and the day,|and the sun|and the moon,|and the stars|(are) subjected|by His command.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) signs|for a people|who use reason.
And whatever|He multiplied|for you|in|the earth|(of) varying|colors.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (is) a sign|for a people|who remember.
And He|(is) the One Who|subjected|the sea|for you to eat|from it|meat|fresh|and that you bring forth|from it,|ornaments|(that) you wear them.|And you see|the ships|ploughing|through it,|and that you may seek|of|His Bounty,|and that you may|(be) grateful.
And He has cast|in|the earth|firm mountains,|lest|it should shake|with you,|and rivers|and roads|so that you may|be guided,
And landmarks.|And by the stars|they|guide themselves.
Then is He Who|creates|like one who|(does) not|create?.|Then will you not|remember?
And if|you should count|the Favors of Allah,||not|you could enumerate them.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And Allah|knows|what|you conceal|and what|you reveal.
And those whom|they invoke|besides||Allah|not|they create|anything,|but (are) themselves|created.
(They are) dead|not alive.||And not|they perceive|when|they will be resurrected.
Your god|(is) God|One.|But those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter,|their hearts|refuse,|and they|(are) arrogant.
No doubt||that|Allah|knows|what|they conceal|and what|they reveal.|Indeed, He|(does) not|love|the arrogant ones.
And when|it is said|to them,|"What|has your Lord sent down?||They say,|"Tales|(of) the ancient."
That they may bear|their own burdens|(in) full|on (the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|and of|the burdens|(of) those whom|they misled [them]|without|knowledge.|Unquestionably,|evil|(is) what|they will bear.
Verily,|plotted|those who|(were) before them,||but Allah came||(at) their building|from|the foundations,|so fell|upon them|the roof|from|above them,|and came to them|the punishment|from|where|they (did) not perceive.|
Then|(on) the Day|(of) the Resurrection,|He will disgrace them|and say,|"Where|(are) My partners|those (for) whom|you used (to)|oppose|[in them]?"|Will say|those who|were given|the knowledge,|"Indeed,|the disgrace,|this Day|and evil|(are) upon|the disbelievers"
Those whom -|take them in death|the Angels|(while) wronging|themselves,|then they would offer|the submission,|"Not|we were|doing|any|evil."|Nay,|indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knower|of what|you used (to)|do.
So enter|(the) gates|(of) Hell|(to) abide forever|in it.|Surely, wretched|(is the) abode|(of) the arrogant.
And it will be said|to those who|fear Allah,|"What|has your Lord sent down?"||They will say,|"Good."|For those who|do good|in|this|world|(is) a good,|and the home|of the Hereafter|(is) better.|And surely excellent|(is) the home|(of) the righteous.
Gardens|(of) Eden -|which they will enter,|flows|from|underneath them|the rivers.|For them|therein|(will be) whatever|they wish.|Thus|Allah rewards||the righteous,
Those whom|take them in death|the Angels|(when they are) pure|saying,|"Peace|(be) upon you.|Enter|Paradise|for what|you used (to)|do."
Do|they wait|except|that|(should) come to them|the Angels|or|(should) come|(the) Command|(of) your Lord?|Thus|did|those who|(were) before them.||And not|wronged them|Allah|but|they were|themselves|wronging.
Then struck them|(the) evil (results)|(of) what|they did,|and surrounded|them|what|they used (to)|[of it]|mock.
And said|those who|associate partners (with Allah),|"If|Allah (had) willed||not|we (would) have worshipped|other than Him||any|thing,|we|and not|our forefathers|and not|we (would) have forbidden|other than Him||anything."||Thus|did|those who|(were) before them.||Then is (there)|on|the messengers|except|the conveyance|clear?
And certainly,|We sent|into|every|nation|a Messenger,|that,|"Worship|Allah,|and avoid|the false deities."|Then among them|(were some) whom|Allah guided,||and among them|(were) some|was justified|on them|the straying.|So travel|in|the earth|and see|how|was|the end|(of) the deniers.
If|you desire|[for]|their guidance,|then indeed,|Allah|(will) not|guide|whom|He lets go astray,|and not (are)|for them|any|helpers.
And they swear|by Allah|strongest|(of) their oaths,|Allah will not resurrect|||(one) who|dies.|Nay,|(it is) a promise|upon Him|(in) truth,|but|most|(of) the mankind|(do) not|know.
That He will make clear|to them|that|they differ|wherein,|and that may know|those who|disbelieved|that they|were|liars.
Only|Our Word|to a thing|when|We intend it|(is) that|We say|to it,|"Be"|and it is.
And those who|emigrated|in (the way)|(of) Allah|after||[what]|they were wronged,|surely We will give them position|in|the world|good,|but surely the reward|(of) the Hereafter|(is) greater,|if|they|know.
Those who|(are) patient|and on|their Lord|they put their trust.
And not|We sent|before you||except|men,|We revealed|to them,|so ask|(the) people|(of) the Reminder|if|you|(do) not|know.
With the clear proofs|and the Books.|And We sent down|to you|the Remembrance,|that you may make clear|to the mankind,|what|has been sent down|to them|and that they may|reflect.
Do then feel secure|those who|plotted|the evil deeds|that|Allah will cave||with them|the earth|or|will come to them|the punishment|from|where|not|they perceive?
Or|that He may seize them|in|their going to and fro|then not|they|will be able to escape?
Or|that He may seize them|with|a gradual wasting|But indeed,|your Lord|(is) surely Full of Kindness,|Most Merciful.
Have not|they seen|[towards]|what|Allah has created||from|a thing?|Incline|their shadows|to|the right|and to the left,|prostrating|to Allah|while they|(are) humble?
And to Allah|prostrate|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth|of|moving creatures|and the Angels,|and they|(are) not|arrogant.
They fear|their Lord|above them,||and they do|what|they are commanded.
And Allah has said,||"(Do) not|take|[two] gods|two,|only|He|(is) God|One,|so Me alone|you fear [Me]."
And to Him (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth|and to Him|(is due) the worship|constantly.|Then is it other (than)|Allah|you fear?
And whatever|you have|of|favor|(is) from|Allah.|Then|when|touches you|the adversity|then to Him|you cry for help.
Then|when|He removes|the adversity|from you,|behold |A group|of you|with their Lord|associate others,
So as to deny|that which|We have given them.|Then enjoy yourselves,|soon|you will know.
And they assign|to what|not|they know -|a portion,|of what|We have provided them.|By Allah|surely you will be asked|about what|you used (to)|invent.
And they assign|to Allah|daughters.|Glory be to Him |And for them|(is) what|they desire.
And when|is given good news|(to) one of them|of a female,|turns|his face|dark|and he|suppresses grief.
He hides himself|from|the people|(because) of|the evil|of what|he has been given good news|about.|Should he keep it|in|humiliation|or|bury it|in|the dust?|Unquestionably,|evil|(is) what|they decide.
For those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter,|(is) a similitude|(of) the evil,|and for Allah|(is) the similitude|the Highest.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
And if|Allah were to seize||the mankind|for their wrongdoing|not|He (would) have left|upon it|any|moving creature,|but|He defers them|for|a term|appointed.|Then when|comes|their terms|not|they (will) remain behind|an hour|and not|they can advance (it).
And they assign|to Allah|what|they dislike|and assert|their tongues|the lie|that|for them|(is) the best.|No|doubt|that|for them|(is) the Fire|and that they|(will) be abandoned.
By Allah,|certainly|We have sent|to|nations|before you||but made fair-seeming|to them|the Shaitaan|their deeds.|So he|(is) their ally|today,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
And not|We revealed|to you|the Book|except|that you make clear|to them|that which|they differed|in it,|and (as) a guidance|and mercy|for a people|who believe.
And Allah|sends down|from|the sky|water,|then gives life|by it|(to) the earth|after|its death.|Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a Sign|for a people|who listen.
And indeed,|for you|in|the cattle|(is) a lesson.|We give you to drink|from what|(is) in|their bellies,|from|between|bowels|and blood,|milk|pure,|palatable|to the drinkers.
And from|fruits|the date-palm,|and the grapes,|you take|from it|intoxicant|and a provision|good.|Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a Sign|for a people|who use reason.
And inspired|your Lord|to|the bee,|[that]|"Take|among|the mountains,|houses|and among|the trees,|and in what|they construct.
Then|eat|from|all|the fruits|and follow|(the) ways|(of) your Lord|made smooth."|Comes forth|from|their bellies|a drink|(of) varying|colors,|in it|(is) a healing|for the mankind.|Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a Sign|for a people|who reflect.
And Allah|created you,|then|will cause you to die.|And among you|(is one) who|is sent back|to|the worst|(of) the age,|so that|not|he will know|after|knowledge|a thing.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knowing,|All-Powerful.
And Allah|has favored|some of you|over|others|in|[the] provision.|But not|those who|were favored|would hand over|their provision|to|whom|possess|their right hands,|so (that) they|(are) in it|equal.|Then is it the Favor|of Allah|they reject?
And Allah|(has) made|for you|from|yourselves|spouses,|and has made|for you|from|your spouses|sons|and grandsons|and has provided for you|from|the good things.|Then in falsehood do|they believe,|and the Favor|of Allah|they|disbelieve?
And they worship|other than||Allah|which|not|possesses|for them|any provision|from|the heavens|and the earth|[anything],|and not|they are able.
So (do) not|put forth|for Allah|the similitude.|Indeed,|Allah|knows|and you|(do) not|know.
Allah sets forth||the example|(of) a slave|(who is) owned,|not|he has power|on|anything|and (one) whom|We provided him|from Us|a provision|good,|so he|spends|from it,|secretly|and publicly.|Can|they be equal?|All praise|(is) for Allah |Nay,|but most of them|(do) not|know.
And Allah sets forth||an example|(of) two men,|one of them|(is) dumb,|not|he has power|on|anything,|while he|(is) a burden|on|his master.|Wherever|he directs him|not|he comes|with any good.|Is|equal|he|and (the one) who|commands|[of] justice,|and he|(is) on|a path|straight?
And to Allah (belongs)|(the) unseen|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|And not|(is the) matter|(of) the Hour|but|as a twinkling|(of) the eye|or|it|(is) nearer.|Indeed,|Allah|on|every|thing|(is) All-Powerful.
And Allah|brought you forth|from|the wombs|(of) your mothers,|not|knowing|anything,|and made|for you|the hearing|and the sight|and the hearts|so that you may|give thanks.
Do not|they see|towards|the birds|controlled|in|the midst|(of) the sky?|None|holds them up|except|Allah.|Indeed,|in|that|(are) Signs|for a people|who believe.
And Allah|(has) made|for you|[from]|your homes|a resting place,|and made|for you|from|the hides|(of) the cattle|tents,|which you find light|(on) the day|(of) your travel|and the day|(of) your encampment;|and from|their wool|and their fur|and their hair|(is) furnishing|and a provision|for|a time.
And Allah|(has) made|for you|from what|He created,|shades|and (has) made|for you|from|the mountains,|shelters|and (has) made|for you|garments|to protect you|(from) the heat|and garments|to protect you|from your (mutual) violence.|Thus|He completes|His Favor|upon you|so that you may|submit.
Then, if|they turn away|then only|upon you|(is) the conveyance|the clear.
They recognize|(the) Favor|(of) Allah;|then|they deny it.|And most of them|(are) the disbelievers.
And the Day|We will resurrect|from|every|nation|a witness,|then|not|will be permitted|to those who|disbelieved|and not|they|will be asked to make amends.
And when|(will) see|those who|wronged|the punishment,|then not|it will be lightened|for them|and not|they|will be given respite.
And when|(will) see|those who|associated partners with Allah|their partners.|They will say,|"Our Lord,|these|(are) our partners|those whom|we used to|invoke|besides You."||But they (will) throw back|at them|(their) word,|"Indeed, you|(are) surely liars."
And they (will) offer|to|Allah|(on) that Day|the submission,|and (is) lost|from them|what|they used (to)|invent.
And those who|disbelieved|and hindered|from|(the) way|(of) Allah,|We will increase them|(in) punishment|over|punishment|because|they used (to)|spread corruption.
And the Day|We will resurrect|among|every|nation|a witness|over them|from|themselves.|And We (will) bring|you|(as) a witness|over|these.|And We sent down|to you|the Book|(as) a clarification|of every|thing|and a guidance|and mercy|and glad tidings|for the Muslims.
Indeed,|Allah|commands|justice|and the good,|and giving|(to) relatives,||and forbids|[from]|the immorality|and the bad|and the oppression.|He admonishes you|so that you may|take heed.
And fulfil|the covenant|(of) Allah|when|you have taken a covenant,|and (do) not|break|oaths|after|their confirmation|while verily|you have made|Allah|over you|a surety.|Indeed,|Allah|knows|what|you do.
And (do) not|be|like her who|untwists|her spun yarn|after||strength|(into) untwisted strands;|you take|your oaths|(as) a deception|between you,|because|is|a community|[it]|more numerous|than|(another) community.|Only,|Allah tests you||by it.|And He will make clear|to you|(on) the Day|(of) the Resurrection,|what|you used (to)|in it|differ.
And if|Allah (had) willed||surely He (could) have made you|a nation|one,|but|He lets go astray|whom|He wills|and guides|whom|He wills.|And surely you will be questioned|about what|you used (to)|do.
And (do) not|take|your oaths|(as) a deception|between you,|lest, should slip|a foot|after|it is firmly planted,|and you would taste|the evil|for what|you hindered|from|(the) way|(of) Allah|and for you|(is) a punishment|great.
And (do) not|exchange|the covenant|(of) Allah,|(for) a price|little.|Indeed, what|(is) with|Allah,|it|(is) better|for you|if|you were (to)|know.
Whatever|(is) with you|will be exhausted,|and whatever|(is) with|Allah|(will) be remaining.|And surely We will pay|those who|(are) patient|their reward|to (the) best|(of) what|they used (to)|do.
Whoever|does|righteous deeds|whether|male|or|female|while he|(is) a believer,|then surely We will give him life,|a life|good,|and We will pay them|their reward|to (the) best|of what|they used (to)|do.
So when|you recite|the Quran,|seek refuge|in Allah|from|the Shaitaan,|the accursed.
Indeed he,|not|for him|(is) any authority|on|those who|believe|and upon|their Lord|they put their trust.
Only|his authority|(is) over|those who|take him as an ally|and those who|[they]|with Him|associate partners.
And when|We substitute|a Verse|(in) place|(of) a Verse,|and Allah -|(is) most knowing|of what|He sends down|they say,|"Only|you|(are) an inventor."|Nay,|most of them|(do) not|know.
Say,|"Has brought it down|the Holy Spirit||from|your Lord|in truth,|to make firm|those who|believe|and (as) a guidance|and glad tidings|to the Muslims."
And certainly|We know|that they|say,|"Only|teaches him|a human being."|(The) tongue|(of) the one|they refer|to him|(is) foreign|while this|(is) a language|Arabic|clear.
Indeed,|those who|(do) not|believe|in the Verses|(of) Allah,|not|Allah will guide them||and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
Only|they invent|the falsehood|those who|(do) not|believe|in the Verses|(of) Allah,|and those -|they|(are) the liars.
Whoever|disbelieves|in Allah|after||his belief,|except|(one) who|is forced|while his heart|(is) content|with the faith.|But|(one) who|opens|to disbelief|(his) breast|then upon them|(is) a wrath|of|Allah|and for them|(is) a punishment|great.
That (is)|because|they preferred|the life|(of) the world|over|the Hereafter|and that|Allah|(does) not|guide|the people|the disbelievers.
Those|(are) the ones -|Allah has set a seal||over|their hearts|and their hearing|and their sight.|And those -|they are|the heedless.
No|doubt|that they|in|the Hereafter|[they]|(are) the losers.
Then|indeed,|your Lord,|to those who|emigrated|after||what|they had been put to trials|then|strove hard|and were patient.|Indeed,|your Lord,|after it,||surely is Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
(On) the Day|(when) will come|every|soul|pleading|for|itself,|and will be paid in full|every|soul|what|it did|and they|(will) not|be wronged.
And Allah sets forth||a similitude|(of) a town|(that) was|secure|and content,|coming to it|its provision|(in) abundance|from|every|place,|but it denied|(the) Favors of Allah,||so Allah made it taste||(the) garb|(of) the hunger|and the fear|for what|they used (to)|do.
And certainly|came to them|a Messenger|from among them|but they denied him;|so seized them|the punishment|while they|(were) wrongdoers.
So eat|of what|Allah has provided you -||lawful|and good.|And be grateful|(for the) Favor|(of) Allah,|if|[you]|Him Alone|you worship.
Only|He has forbidden|to you|the dead animal|and the blood|and the flesh|(of) the swine,|and what|has been dedicated|to other (than)|Allah|[with it].|But (if) one|(is) forced -|without (being)|disobedient,|and not|a transgressor -|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And (do) not|say|for that which|assert|your tongues,|the lie,|"This|(is) lawful|and this|(is) forbidden,"|so that you invent|about|Allah|the lie.|Indeed,|those who|invent|about|Allah|the lie,|they will not succeed.|
An enjoyment|little|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
And to|those who|are Jews|We have forbidden|what|We related|to you|before.||And not|We wronged them|but|they used (to)|themselves|wrong.
Then|indeed,|your Lord,|to those who|did|evil|in ignorance,|then|repented|after||that,|and corrected themselves -|indeed,|your Lord,|after that||(is) surely Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|Ibrahim|was|a nation|obedient|to Allah|upright,|and not|he was|of|the polytheists.
Thankful|for His favors.|He chose him|and guided him|to|the way|straight.
And We gave him|in|the world|good,|and indeed, he|in|the Hereafter|(he) will surely (be) among|the righteous.
Then|We revealed|to you,|that,|"You follow|(the) religion|(of) Ibrahim|upright;|and not|he was|of|the polytheists."
Only|was appointed|the Sabbath|for|those who|differed|in it.|And indeed,|your Lord|will surely judge|between them|(on) the Day|(of) the Resurrection|in what|they used (to)|[in it]|differ.
Call|to|(the) way|(of) your Lord|with the wisdom|and the instruction|the good,|and discuss with them|in that|which|(is) best.|Indeed,|your Lord,|He|(is) most knowing|of who|has strayed|from|His way,|And He|(is) most knowing|of the guided ones.
And if|you retaliate,|then retaliate|with the like|of what|you were afflicted|with [it].|But if|you are patient,|surely (it) is|better|for those who are patient.
And be patient|and not|(is) your patience|but|from Allah.|And (do) not|grieve|over them|and (do) not|be|in|distress|for what|they plot.
Indeed,|Allah|(is) with|those who|fear (Him)|and those who|[they]|(are) good-doers.
Exalted|(is) the One Who|took|His servant|(by) night|from|Al-Masjid Al-Haraam,||to|Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa||which|We blessed|its surroundings,|that We may show him|of|Our Signs.|Indeed He,|He|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Seer.
And We gave|Musa|the Book,|and made it|a guidance|for the Children|(of) Israel,|"That not|you take|other than Me||(as) a Disposer of affairs."
Offsprings|(of one) who|We carried|with|Nuh.|Indeed, he|was|a servant|grateful.
And We decreed|for|(the) Children|(of) Israel|in|the Book,|"Surely you will cause corruption|in|the earth|twice,|and surely you will reach,|haughtiness|great."
So when|came|(the) promise|(for) the first of the two,|We raised|against you|servants|of Ours|those of great military might|||and they entered|the inner most part|(of) the homes,|and (it) was|a promise|fulfilled.
Then|We gave back|to you|the return victory|over them.|And We reinforced you|with the wealth|and sons|and made you|more|numerous.
If|you do good,|you do good|for yourselves;|and if|you do evil,|then it is for it.|So when|came|promise|the last,|to sadden|your faces|and to enter|the Masjid|just as|they (had) entered it|first|time,|and to destroy|what|they had conquered|(with) destruction.
"(It) may be|that your Lord||(may) have mercy upon you.|But if|you return,|We will return.|And We have made|Hell,|for the disbelievers,|a prison-bed."
Indeed,|this,|the Quran,|guides|to that|which|(is) most straight|and gives glad tidings|to the believers -|those who|do|the righteous deeds,|that|for them|(is) a reward|great,
And that|those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter,|We have prepared|for them|a punishment|painful.
And prays|the man|for evil|(as) he prays|for the good.|And is|the man|ever hasty.
And We have made|the night|and the day|(as) two signs.|Then We erased|(the) sign|(of) the night,|and We made|(the) sign|(of) the day|visible,|that you may seek|bounty|from|your Lord,|and that you may know|(the) number|(of) the years,|and the account.|And every|thing -|We have explained it|(in) detail.
And (for) every|man|We have fastened to him|his fate|in|his neck,|and We will bring forth|for him|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|a record|which he will find|wide open.
"Read|your record.|Sufficient|(is) yourself|today,|against you|(as) accountant."
Whoever|(is) guided|then only|he is guided|for his soul.|And whoever|goes astray|then only|he goes astray|against it|And not|will bear|one laden with burden,|burden|(of) another.|And not|We|are to punish|until,|We have sent|a Messenger.
And when|We intend|that|We destroy|a town,|We order|its wealthy people|but they defiantly disobey|therein;|so (is) proved true|against it|the word,|and We destroy it|(with) destruction.
And how many|We destroyed|from|the generations|after||Nuh |And sufficient|(is) your Lord|concerning the sins|(of) His servants|All-Aware,|All-Seer.
Whoever|should|desire|the immediate|We hasten|for him|in it|what|We will|to whom|We intend.|Then|We have made|for him|Hell,|he will burn|disgraced|rejected.
And whoever|desires|the Hereafter|and exerts|for it|the effort,|while he|(is) a believer,|then those|[are]|their effort,|(is) appreciated.
(To) each|We extend|(to) these|and (to) these,|from|(the) gift|(of) your Lord.|And not|is|(the) gift|(of) your Lord|restricted.
See|how|We preferred|some of them|over|others.|And surely the Hereafter|(is) greater|(in) degrees|and greater|(in) excellence.
(Do) not|make|with|Allah|god|another,|lest you will sit|disgraced,|forsaken.
And has decreed|your Lord,|that (do) not|worship|except|Him alone,|and to the parents|(be) good.|Whether|reach|with you|the old age|one of them,|or|both of them,|then (do) not|say|to both of them|a word of disrespect|and (do) not|repel them,|but speak|to them|a word|noble.
And lower|to them|(the) wing|(of) humility|(out) of|[the] mercy|and say,|"My Lord |Have mercy on both of them|as|they brought me up|(when I was) small."
Your Lord|(is) most knowing|of what|(is) in|yourselves.|If|you are|righteous,|then indeed, He|is|to those who often turn (to Him)|Most Forgiving.
And give|the relatives||his right,|and the needy,|and the wayfarer,||and (do) not|spend|wastefully.
Indeed,|the spendthrifts|are|brothers|(of) the devils.|And is|the Shaitaan|to his Lord|ungrateful.
And if|you turn away|from them|seeking|mercy|from|your Lord,|which you expect|then say|to them|a word|gentle.
And (do) not|make|your hand|chained|to|your neck,|and not|extend it|(to its) utmost|reach,|so that you sit|blameworthy,|insolvent.
Indeed,|your Lord|extends|the provision|for whom|He wills,|and straitens.|Indeed, He|is|of His slaves|All-Aware,|All-Seer.
And (do) not|kill|your children|(for) fear|(of) poverty.|We,|(We) provide for them|and for you.|Indeed,|their killing|is|a sin|great.
And (do) not|go near|adultery.|Indeed, it|is|an immorality|and (an) evil|way.
And (do) not|kill|the soul|which|Allah has forbidden,||except|by right.|And whoever|(is) killed|wrongfully,|verily|We have made|for his heir|an authority,|but not|he should exceed|in|the killing.|Indeed, he|is|helped.
And (do) not|come near|(the) wealth|(of) the orphan,|except|with what|[it] is|best|until|he reaches|his maturity.|And fulfil|the covenant.|Indeed,|the covenant|will be|questioned.
And give full|[the] measure|when|you measure,|and weigh|with the balance|the straight.|That|(is) good|and best|(in) result.
And (do) not|pursue|what|not|you have|of it|any knowledge.|Indeed,|the hearing,|and the sight,|and the heart|all|those|will be|[about it]|questioned.
And (do) not|walk|in|the earth|(with) insolence.|Indeed, you|will never|tear|the earth|and will never|reach|the mountains|(in) height.
All|that|is|[its] evil|near|your Lord,|hateful.
That|(is) from what|(was) revealed|to you|(from) your Lord|of|the wisdom.|And (do) not|make|with|Allah|god|other|lest you should be thrown|in|Hell,|blameworthy,|abandoned.
Then has your Lord chosen (for) you||sons|and He has taken|from|the Angels|daughters?|Indeed, you|surely say|a word|grave.
And verily,|We have explained|in|this|the Quran,|that they may take heed,|but not|it increases them|except|(in) aversion.
Say,|"If|(there) were|with Him|gods|as|they say,|then|surely they (would) have sought|to|(the) Owner|(of) the Throne|a way."
Glorified is He|and Exalted is He|above what|they say|(by) height|great.
Glorify|[to] Him|the seven heavens||and the earth|and whatever|(is) in them.|And (there is) not|any|thing|except|glorifies|His Praise,|but|not|you understand|their glorification.|Indeed, He|is|Ever-Forbearing,|Oft-Forgiving."
And when|you recite|the Quran,|We place|between you|and between|those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter|a barrier|hidden.
And We have placed|over|their hearts|coverings,|lest|they understand it,|and in|their ears|deafness.|And when|you mention|your Lord|in|the Quran|Alone,|they turn|on|their backs|(in) aversion.
We|know best|[of] what|they listen|to [it]|when|they listen|to you,|and when|they|(are) in private conversation,|when|say|the wrongdoers,|"Not|you follow|but|a man|bewitched."
See|how|they put forth|for you|the examples;|but they have gone astray|so not|they can|(find) a way.
And they say,|"Is it when|we are|bones|and crumbled particles,|will we|surely (be) resurrected|(as) a creation|new."
Say,|"Be|stones|or|iron.
Or|a creation|of what|(is) great|in|your breasts."|Then they will say,|"Who|will restore us?"|Say,|"He Who|created you|(the) first|time."|Then they will shake|at you|their heads|and they say,|"When (will)|it (be)?"|Say,|"Perhaps|that|(it) will be|soon."
(On) the Day|He will call you|and you will respond|with His Praise,|and you will think,|not|you had remained|except|a little (while).
And say|to My slaves|(to) say|that|which|(is) best.|Indeed,|the Shaitaan|sows discord|between them.|Indeed,|the Shaitaan|is|to the man|an enemy|clear.
Your Lord|(is) most knowing|of you.|If|He wills,|He will have mercy on you;|or|if|He wills|He will punish you.|And not|We have sent you|over them|(as) a guardian.
And your Lord|(is) most knowing|of whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|And verily|We have preferred|some|(of) the Prophets|to|others.|And We gave|Dawood|Zaboor.
Say,|"Call|those whom|you claimed|besides Him,||[then] not|they have power|(to) remove|the misfortunes|from you|and not|(to) transfer (it)."
Those|whom|they call,|seek|to|their Lord|the means of access,|which of them|(is) nearest,|and they hope|(for) His mercy|and fear|His punishment.|Indeed,|(the) punishment|(of) your Lord|is|(ever) feared.
And not|(is) any|town|but|We|(will) destroy it|before|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|or|punish it|with a punishment|severe.|That is||in|the Book|written.
And not|stopped Us|that|We send|the Signs|except|that|denied|them|the former people.|And We gave|Thamud|the she-camel|(as) a visible sign,|but they wronged|her.|And not|We send|the Signs|except|(as) a warning.
And when|We said|to you,|"Indeed,|your Lord|has encompassed|the mankind."|And not|We made|the vision|which|We showed you|except|(as) a trial|for mankind,|and the tree|the accursed|in|the Quran.|And We threaten them|but not|it increases them|except|(in) transgression|great.
And when|We said|to the Angels,|"Prostrate|to Adam."|So they prostrated|except|Iblis.|He said,|"Shall I prostrate|to (one) whom|You created|(from) clay?"
He said,|"Do You see|this|whom|You have honored,|above me?|If|You give me respite|till|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|I will surely destroy|his offspring|except|a few."
He said,|"Go,|and whoever|follows you|among them|then indeed,|Hell|(is) your recompense -|a recompense|ample.
And incite|whoever|you can|among them|with your voice,|and assault|[on] them|with your cavalry|and infantry|and be a partner|in|the wealth|and the children,|and promise them."|And not|promises them|the Shaitaan|except|delusion.
"Indeed,|My slaves|not|for you|over them|any authority.|And sufficient|(is) your Lord|(as) a Guardian."
Your Lord|(is) the One Who|drives|for you|the ship|in|the sea,|that you may seek|of|His Bounty.|Indeed, He|is|to you|Ever Merciful.
And when|touches you|the hardship|in|the sea,|lost|(are) who|you call|except|Him Alone.|But when|He delivers you|to|the land|you turn away.|And is|man|ungrateful.
Do you then feel secure|that (not)|He will cause to swallow|you,|side|(of) the land|or|send|against you|a storm of stones?|Then|not|you will find|for you|a guardian?
Or|do you feel secure|that (not)|He will send you back|into it|another time,||and send|upon you|a hurricane|of|the wind,|and drown you|because|you disbelieved?|Then|not|you will find|for you|against Us|therein|an avenger?
And certainly,|We have honored|(the) children of Adam||and We carried them|on|the land|and the sea,|and We have provided them|of|the good things|and We preferred them|over|many|of those whom|We have created|(with) preference.
(The) Day|We will call|all|human beings|with their record,|then whoever|is given|his record|in his right hand,|then those|will read|their records,|and not|they will be wronged|(even as much as) a hair on a date seed.
And whoever|is|in|this (world)|blind,|then he|in|the Hereafter|(will be) blind,|and more astray|(from the) path.
And indeed,|they were about (to)|tempt you away|from|that which|We revealed,|to you|that you invent|about Us|other (than) it.|And then|surely they would take you|(as) a friend.
And if not|[that]|We (had) strengthened you,|certainly,|you almost|(would) have inclined|to them|(in) something|a little.
Then|We (would) have made you taste|double|(in) the life,|and double|(after) the death.|Then|not|you (would) have found|for you|against Us|any helper.
And indeed,|they were about|(to) scare you|from|the land,|that they evict you|from it.|But then|not|they (would) have stayed|after you|except|a little.
(Such is Our) Way|(for) whom|[verily]|We sent|before you|of|Our Messengers.|And not|you will find|(in) Our way|any alteration.
Establish|the prayer,|at the decline|(of) the sun|till|(the) darkness|(of) the night|and Quran|at dawn,|indeed,|the Quran|(at) the dawn|is|ever witnessed.
And from|the night|arise from sleep for prayer|with it|(as) additional|for you;|it may be|that|will raise you|your Lord|(to) a station|praiseworthy.
And say,|"My Lord |Cause me to enter|an entrance|sound,|and cause me to exit|an exit|sound|and make|for me|from|near You|an authority|helping."
And say,|"Has come|the truth|and perished|the falsehood.|Indeed,|the falsehood|is|(bound) to perish."
And We reveal|from|the Quran|that|it|(is) a healing|and a mercy|for the believers,|but not|it increases|the wrongdoers|except|(in) loss.
And when|We bestow favor|on|man|he turns away|and becomes remote|on his side.|And when|touches him|the evil|he is|(in) despair.
Say,|"Each|works|on|his manner,|but your Lord|(is) most knowing|of who|[he]|(is) best guided|(in) way."
And they ask you|concerning|the soul.|Say,|"The soul|(is) of|(the) affair|(of) my Lord.|And not|you have been given|of|the knowledge|except|a little."
And if|We willed,|We (would) have surely taken away|that which|We have revealed|to you.|Then|not|you would find|for you|concerning it|against Us|any advocate,
Except|a mercy|from|your Lord.|Indeed,|His Bounty|is|upon you|great.
Say,|"If|gathered|the mankind|and the jinn|to|[that]|bring|the like|(of) this|Quran,|not|they (could) bring|the like of it,|even if|were|some of them|to some others|assistants."
And verily|We have explained|to mankind|in|this|Quran|from|every|example,|but refused|most|(of) the mankind|except|disbelief.
And they say,|"Never|we will believe|in you|until|you cause to gush forth|for us|from|the earth|a spring.
Or|you have|for you|a garden|of|date-palms|and grapes,|and cause to gush forth|the rivers|within them|abundantly.
Or|you cause to fall|the sky,|as|you have claimed,|upon us|(in) pieces|or|you bring|Allah|and the Angels|before (us).
Or|is|for you|a house|of|ornament|or|you ascend|into|the sky.|And never|we will believe|in your ascension|until|you bring down|to us|a book|we could read it."|Say,|"Glorified (is)|my Lord |"What|am I|but|a human,|a Messenger."
And what|prevented|the people|that|they believe|when|came to them|the guidance|except|that|they said,|"Has Allah sent||a human|Messenger?"
Say,|"If|(there) were|in|the earth|Angels|walking|securely,|surely We (would) have sent down|to them|from|the heaven|an Angel|(as) a Messenger."
Say,|"Sufficient is|Allah|(as) a witness|between me|and between you.|Indeed, He|is|of His slaves|All-Aware,|All-Seer.
And whoever|Allah guides||then he (is)|the guided one;|and whoever|He lets go astray -|then never|you will find|for them|protectors|besides Him.||And We will gather them|(on) the Day|(of) the Resurrection|on|their faces -|blind|and dumb|and deaf.|Their abode|(is) Hell;|every time|it subsides,|We (will) increase (for) them|the blazing fire.
That|(is) their recompense|because they|disbelieved|in Our Verses|and said,|"When|we are|bones|and crumbled particles,|will we|surely (be) resurrected|(as) a creation|new."
Do not|they see|that|Allah,|the One Who,|created|the heavens|and the earth|(is) Able|[on]|to|create|the like of them?|And He has made|for them|a term,|no|doubt|in it.|But refused|the wrongdoers|except|disbelief.
Say,|"If|you|possess|the treasures|(of) the Mercy|(of) my Lord,|then|surely you would withhold|(out of) fear|(of) spending."|And is|man|stingy.
And certainly|We had given|Musa|nine|Signs|clear,|so ask|(the) Children of Israel||when|he came to them,|then said|to him|Firaun,|"Indeed, I|[I] think you -|O Musa |(you are) bewitched."
He said,|"Verily,|you know|none|has sent down|these|except|(the) Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth|(as) evidence,|and indeed, I|[I] surely think you|O Firaun |(you are) destroyed."
So he intended|to|drive them out|from|the land,|but We drowned him|and who|(were) with him|all.
And We said|after him||to the Children of Israel,||"Dwell|(in) the land,|then when|comes|(the) promise|(of) the Hereafter,|We will bring|you|(as) a mixed crowd."
And with the truth|We sent it down,|and with the truth|it descended.|And not|We sent you|except|(as) a bearer of  glad tidings|and a warner.
And the Quran|We have divided,|that you might recite it|to|the people|at|intervals.|And We have revealed it|(in) stages.
Say,|"Believe|in it|or|(do) not|believe.|Indeed,|those who|were given|the knowledge|before it,||when|it is recited|to them,|they fall|on their faces|(in) prostration."
And they say,|"Glory be to|our Lord |Indeed,|is|(the) promise|(of) our Lord|surely fulfilled."
And they fall|on their faces|weeping,|and it increases them|(in) humility.
Say,|"Invoke|Allah|or|invoke|the Most Gracious.|By whatever (name)||you invoke,|to Him (belongs)|the Most Beautiful Names.||And (do) not|be loud|in your prayers|and not|be silent|therein,|but seek|between|that|a way."
And say,|"All Praise|(is) for Allah|the One Who|has not taken||a son|and not|is|for Him|a partner|in|the dominion,|and not|is|for Him|any protector|out of|weakness.|And magnify Him|(with all) magnificence."
All Praise|(is) for Allah|the One Who|(has) revealed|to|His slave|the Book,|and not|(has) made|in it|any crookedness.
Straight,|to warn|(of) a punishment|severe,|from|near Him,|and give glad tidings|(to) the believers,|those who|do|righteous deeds,|that|for them|(is) a good reward.|
(They will) abide|in it|forever.
And to warn|those who|say,|"Allah has taken||a son."
Not|they have|about it|any|knowledge|and not|their forefathers.|Mighty (is)|the word|(that) comes out|of|their mouths.|Not|they say|except|a lie.
Then perhaps you would (be)|the one who kills|yourself|over|their footsteps,|if|not|they believe|in this|[the] narration,|(in) grief.
Indeed, We|We have made|what|(is) on|the earth|adornment|for it,|that We may test [them]|which of them|(is) best|(in) deed.
And indeed, We|(will) surely make|what|(is) on it|soil|barren.
Or|you think|that|(the) companions|(of) the cave|and the inscription|were,|among|Our Signs,|a wonder?
When|retreated|the youths|to|the cave,|and they said,|"Our Lord |Grant us|from|Yourself|Mercy,|and facilitate|for us|[from]|our affair|(in the) right way."
So We cast|over|their ears|in|the cave|years -|a number.
Then|We raised them up|that We make evident|which|(of) the two parties|best calculated|for what|(they had) remained|(in) time.
We|narrate|to you|their story|in truth.|Indeed, they (were)|youths|who believed|in their Lord,|and We increased them|(in) guidance.
And We made firm|[on]|their hearts|when|they stood up|and said,|"Our Lord|(is) the Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|Never|we will invoke|besides Him||any god.|Certainly,|we would have said,|then,|an enormity.
These,|our people,|have taken|besides Him||gods.|Why not|they come|to them|with an authority|clear?|And who|(is) more wrong|than (one) who|invents|against|Allah|a lie?
And when|you withdraw from them|and what|they worship|except|Allah,|then retreat|to|the cave.|Will spread|for you|your Lord|of|His Mercy|and will facilitate|for you|[from]|your affair|(in) ease."
And you (might) have seen|the sun,|when|it rose,|inclining away|from|their cave|to|the right,|and when|it set,|passing away from them|to|the left|while they|(lay) in|the open space|thereof.|That|(was) from|(the) Signs|(of) Allah.|Whoever|Allah  guides||and he|(is) the guided one,|and whoever|He lets go astray|then never|you will find|for him|a protector,|a guide.
And you (would) think them|awake|while they|(were) asleep.|And We turned them|to|the right|and to|the left,|while their dog|stretched|his two forelegs|at the entrance.|If|you had looked|at them,|you (would) have surely turned back|from them|(in) flight|and surely you would have been filled|by them|(with) terror.
And similarly,|We raised them|that they might question|among them.|Said|a speaker|among them,|"How long|have you remained?"|They said,|"We have remained|a day|or|a part|(of) a day."|They said,|"Your Lord|knows best|how long|you have remained.|So send|one of you|with this silver coin of yours||to|the city,|and let him see|which is|the purest|food,|and let him bring to you|provision|from it,|and let him be cautious.|And let not be aware||about you|anyone."
"Indeed, [they]|if|they come to know|about you,|they will stone you|or|return you|to|their religion.|And never|will you succeed|then -|ever."
And similarly,|We made known|about them|that they might know|that|(the) Promise|(of) Allah|(is) true,|and that|(about) the Hour|(there is) no|doubt|in it.|When|they disputed|among themselves|about their affair|and they said,|"Construct|over them|a structure.|Their Lord|knows best|about them."|Said|those who|prevailed|in|their matter,|"Surely we will take|over them|a place of worship."
They say,|(they were) three,|the forth of them|their dog;|and they say|(they were) five|the sixth of them|their dog -|guessing|about the unseen;|and they say,|(they were) seven|and the eight of them|their dog.|Say,|"My Lord,|knows best|their number.|None|knows them|except|a few.|So (do) not|argue|about them|except|(with) an argument|obvious,|and (do) not|inquire|about them|among them|(from) anyone."
And (do) not|say|of anything,|"Indeed, I|will do|that|tomorrow."
Except,|"If|Allah wills."||And remember|your Lord|when|you forget|and say,|"Perhaps|[that]|will guide me|my Lord|to a nearer (way)|than|this|right way."
And they remained|in|their cave|(for) three|hundred|years|and add|nine.
Say,|"Allah|knows best|about what (period)|they remained.|For Him|(is the) unseen|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|How clearly He sees |[of it]|And how clearly He hears |Not|for them|besides Him||any|protector,|and not|He shares|[in]|His Commands|(with) anyone."
And recite|what|has been revealed|to you|of|the Book|(of) your Lord.|None|can change|His Words|and never|you will find|besides Him||a refuge.
And be patient,|yourself,|with|those who|call|their Lord|in the morning|and the evening|desiring|His Face.|And (let) not|pass beyond|your eyes|over them,|desiring|adornment|(of) the life|(of) the world,|and (do) not|obey|whom|We have made heedless|his heart|of|Our remembrance,|and follows|his desires|and is|his affair|(in) excess.
And say,|"The truth|(is) from|your Lord,|so whoever|wills -|let him believe|and whoever|wills -|let him disbelieve."|Indeed, We|have prepared|for the wrongdoers|a Fire,|will surround|them|its walls.|And if|they call for relief,|they will be relieved|with water|like molten brass,|(which) scalds|the faces.|Wretched|(is) the drink,|and evil|(is) the resting place.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and did|the good deeds,|indeed, We|will not let go waste||(the) reward|(of one) who|does good|deeds.
Those,|for them|(are) Gardens|of Eden,|flows|from|underneath them|the rivers.|They will be adorned|therein|[of] (with)|bracelets|of|gold|and will wear|garments,|green,|of|fine silk|and heavy brocade,|reclining|therein|on|adorned couches.|Excellent|(is) the reward,|and good|(is) the resting place.
And set forth|to them|the example|of two men:|We provided|for one of them|two gardens|of|grapes,|and We bordered them|with date-palms,|and We placed|between both of them|crops.
Each|(of) the two gardens|brought forth|its produce|and not|did wrong|of it|anything.|And We caused to gush forth|within them|a river.
And was|for him|fruit,|so he said|to his companion|while he|(was) talking with him,|"I am|greater|than you|(in) wealth|and stronger|(in) men."
And he entered|his garden|while he|(was) unjust|to himself.|He said,|"Not|I think|that|will perish|this|ever.
And not|I think|the Hour|will occur.|And if|I am brought back|to|my Lord,|I will surely find|better|than this|(as) a return."
Said|to him|his companion|while he|was talking to him,|"Do you disbelieve|in One Who|created you|from|dust|then|from|a minute quantity of semen|then|fashioned you|(into) a man?
But as for me,|He|(is) Allah,|my Lord,|and not|I associate|with my Lord|anyone.
And why (did you) not,|when|you entered|your garden|say,|'What|Allah wills;||(there is) no|power|except|with Allah.'|If|you see|me|lesser|than you|(in) wealth|and children,
It may be|that my Lord||will give me|better|than|your garden|and will send|upon it|a calamity|from|the sky,|then it will become|ground|slippery,
Or|will become,|its water,|sunken,|so never|you will be able|to find it."|
And were surrounded|his fruits,|so he began|twisting|his hands|over|what|he (had) spent|on it,|while it (had)|collapsed|on|its trellises,|and he said,|"Oh  I wish|I had not associated||with my Lord|anyone."
And not|was|for him|a group|(to) help him|other than||Allah,|and not|was|(he) supported.
There,|the protection|(is) from Allah|the True.|He|(is the) best|(to) reward|and (the) best|(for) the final end.
And present|to them|the example|(of) the life|(of) the world,|like water|which We send down|from|the sky,|then mingles|with it|(the) vegetation|(of) the earth|then becomes|dry stalks,|it (is) scattered|(by) the winds.|And Allah||over|every|thing|(is) All Able.
The wealth|and children|(are) adornment|(of) the life|(of) the world.|But the enduring|good deeds|(are) better|near|your Lord|(for) reward|and better|(for) hope.
And the Day|We will cause (to) move|the mountains|and you will see|the earth|(as) a leveled plain|and We will gather them|and not|We will leave behind|from them|anyone.
And they will be  presented|before|your Lord|(in) rows,|"Certainly,|you have come to Us|as|We created you|the first|time.|Nay,|you claimed|that not|We made|for you|an appointment."
And (will) be placed|the Book|and you will see|the criminals|fearful|of what|(is) in it,|and they will say,|"Oh, woe to us |What  (is) for|this|[the] Book,|not|leaves|a small|and not|a great|except|has enumerated it?"|And they will find|what|they did|presented.|And not|deals unjustly|your Lord|(with) anyone.
And when|We said|to the Angels,|"Prostrate|to Adam,"|so they prostrated|except|Iblis.|(He) was|of|the jinn,|and he rebelled|against|the Command|(of) his Lord.|Will you then take him|and his offspring|(as) protectors|other than Me,||while they|(are) to you|enemies?|Wretched|for the wrongdoers|(is) the exchange.
Not|I made them witness|the creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and not|the creation|(of) themselves|and not|I Am|the One to take|the misleaders|(as) helper(s).
And the Day|He will say,|"Call|My partners,|those who|you claimed,"|then they will call them|but not|they will respond|to them.|And We will make|between them|a barrier.
And will see|the criminals|the Fire,|and they (will be) certain|that they|are to fall in it.|And not|they will find|from it|a way of escape.
And certainly,|We have explained|in|this|the Quran|for mankind|of|every|example.|But is|the man|(in) most|things|quarrelsome.
And nothing|prevents|men|that|they believe|when|has come to them|the guidance|and they ask forgiveness|(of) their Lord,|except|that|comes to them|(the) way|(of) the former (people)|or|comes to them|the punishment|before (them)?
And not|We send|the Messengers|except|(as) bearers of glad tidings|and (as) warners.|And dispute|those who|disbelieve|with falsehood,|to refute|thereby|the truth.|And they take|My Verses|and what|they are warned|(in) ridicule.
And who|(is) more wrong|than (he) who|is reminded|of the Verses|(of) his Lord,|but turns away|from them,|and forgets|what|have sent forth|his hands?|Indeed, We|[We] have placed|over|their hearts|coverings,|lest|they understand it|and in|their ears|(is) deafness.|And if|you call them|to|the guidance,|then never|they will be guided|then|ever.
And your Lord|(is) the Most Forgiving,|Owner|(of) the Mercy.|If|He were to seize them|for what|they have earned,|surely, He (would) have hastened|for them|the punishment.|But|for them|(is) an appointment,|never|they will find|other than it||an escape.
And these|[the] towns,|We destroyed them|when|they wronged,|and We made|for their destruction|an appointed time.
And when|said|Musa|to his boy,|"Not|I will cease|until|I reach|the junction|(of) the two seas|or|I continue|(for) a long period."
But when|they reached|the junction|between them,|they forgot|their fish,|and it took|its way|into|the sea,|slipping away.
Then when|they had passed beyond|he said|to his boy,|"Bring us|our morning meal.|Certainly|we have suffered|in|our journey|this,|fatigue."
He said,|"Did you see,|when|we retired|to|the rock?|Then indeed, I|[I] forgot|the fish.|And not|made me forget it|except|the Shaitaan|that|I mention it.|And it took|its way|into|the sea|amazingly."
He said,|"That|(is) what|we were|seeking."|So they returned|on|their footprints,|retracing.
Then they found|a servant|from|Our servants,|whom We had given|mercy|from|Us,|and We had taught him|from|Us|a knowledge.
Said|to him|Musa,|"May,|I follow you|on|that|you teach me|of what|you have been taught|(of) right guidance?"
He said,|"Indeed, you|never|will be able,|with me,|(to have) patience.
And how can|you have patience|for|what|not|you encompass|of it|any knowledge."
He said,|"You will find me,|if|Allah wills,||patient,|and not|I will disobey|your|order."
He said,|"Then if|you follow me,|(do) not|ask me|about|anything|until|I present|to you|of it|a mention."
So they both set out|until|when|they had embarked|on|the ship|he made a hole in it.|He said,|"Have you made a hole in it,|to drown|its people?|Certainly,|you have done|a thing|grave."
He said,|"Did not|I say,|indeed, you|never|will be able|with me|(to have) patience?"
He said,|"(Do) not,|blame me|for what|I forgot|and (do) not|be hard (upon) me|in|my affair|(raising) difficulty."
Then they both set out|until|when|they met|a boy,|then he killed him.|He said,|"Have you killed|a soul,|pure,|for other than|a soul?|Certainly,|you have done|a thing|evil."
He said,|"Did not|I say|to you|that you,|never|will be able|with me|(to have) patience?"
He said,|"If|I ask you|about|anything|after it,|then (do) not|keep me as a companion.|Verily,|you have reached|from me||an excuse."
So they set out|until|when|they came|(to the) people|(of) a town,|they asked for food|(from) its people,|but they refused|to|offer them hospitality.|Then they found|in it|a wall|(that) want(ed)|to|collapse,|so he set it straight.|He said,|"If|you wished|surely you (could) have taken|for it|a payment."
He said,|"This|(is) parting|between me|and between you.|I will inform you|of (the) interpretation|(of) what|not|you were able|on it|(to have) patience.
As for|the ship,|it was|of (the) poor people|working|in|the sea.|So I intended|that|I cause defect (in) it|(as there) was|after them|a king|who seized|every|ship|(by) force.
And as for|the boy|his parents were||believers,|and we feared|that|he would overburden them|(by) transgression|and disbelief.
So we intended|that|would change for them|their Lord,|a better|than him|(in) purity|and nearer|(in) affection.
And as for|the wall,|it was|for two orphan boys,||in|the town,|and was|underneath it|a treasure|for them|and was|their father|righteous.|So intended|your Lord|that|they reach|their maturity,|and bring forth|their treasure|(as) a mercy|from|your Lord.|And not|I did it|on|my (own) accord.|That|(is the) interpretation|(of) what|not|you were able|on it|(to have) patience."
And they ask you|about|Dhul-qarnain.||Say,|"I will recite|to you|about him|a remembrance."
Indeed, We|[We] established|[for] him|in|the earth,|and We gave him|of|every|thing|a means.
So he followed|a course
Until,|when|he reached|(the) setting place|(of) the sun,|he found it|setting|in|a spring|(of) dark mud,|and he found|near it|a community.|We said,|"O Dhul-qarnain ||Either|[that]|you punish|or|[that]|you take|[in] them|(with) goodness."
He said,|"As for|(one) who|wrongs,|then soon|we will punish him.|Then|he will be returned|to|his Lord,|and He will punish him|(with) a punishment|terrible.
But as for|(one) who|believes|and does|righteous (deeds),|then for him|(is) a reward|good.|And we will speak|to him|from|our command|(with) ease."
Then|he followed|(a) course
Until,|when|he reached|(the) rising place|(of) the sun,|and he found it|rising|on|a community|not|We made|for them|against it||any shelter.
Thus.|And verily,|We encompassed|of what|(was) with him|(of the) information.
Then|he followed|a course
Until,|when|he reached|between|the two mountains,|he found|besides them||a community,|not|who would almost|understand|(his) speech.
They said,|"O Dhul-qarnain ||Indeed,|Yajuj|and Majuj|(are) corrupters|in|the land.|So may|we make|for you|an expenditure|[on]|that|you make|between us|and between them|a barrier?"
He said,|"What|has established me|[in it]|my Lord|(is) better,|but assist me|with strength,|I will make|between you|and between them|a barrier.
Bring me|sheets|(of) iron" -|until,|when|he (had) leveled|between|the two cliffs,|he said,|"Blow,"|until|when|he made it|fire,|he said,|"Bring me,|I pour|over it|molten copper."
So not|they were able|to|scale it|and not|they were able|in it|(to do) any penetration.
He said,|"This|(is) a mercy|from|my Lord.|But when|comes|(the) Promise|(of) my Lord,|He will make it|level.|And is|(the) Promise|(of) my Lord|true."
And We (will) leave|some of them|(on) that Day|to surge|over|others,|and (will be) blown|in|the trumpet,|then We (will) gather them|all together.
And We (will) present|Hell|(on) that Day|to the disbelievers,|(on) display
Those|had been|their eyes|within|a cover|from|My remembrance,|and were|not|able|(to) hear.
Do then think|those who|disbelieve|that|they (can) take|My servants|besides Me||(as) protectors?|Indeed, We -|We have prepared|Hell|for the disbelievers|(as) a lodging.
Say,|"Shall|We inform you|of the greatest losers|(as to their) deeds?
Those -|is lost|their effort|in|the life|(of) the world,|while they|think|that they|(were) acquiring good|(in) work."
Those|(are) the ones who|disbelieve|in the Verses|(of) their Lord,|and the meeting (with) Him.|So (are) vain|their deeds,|so not|We will assign|for them|(on) the Day|(of) the Resurrection|any weight.
That|(is) their recompense -|Hell -|because|they disbelieved,|and took|My Verses|and My Messengers|(in) ridicule.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and did|righteous deeds,|for them will be||Gardens|(of) the Paradise|(as) a lodging,
Abiding forever|in it.|Not|they will desire|from it|any transfer.
Say,|"If|were|the sea|ink,|for (the) Words|(of) my Lord,|surely (would be) exhausted|the sea|before|[that]|(were) exhausted|(the) Words|(of) my Lord,|even if|We brought|(the) like (of) it|(as) a supplement."
Say,|"Only|I|(am) a man|like you.|Has been revealed|to me|that|your God|(is) God|One.|So whoever|is|hoping|(for the) meeting|(with) his Lord,|let him do|deeds|righteous|and not|associate|in (the) worship|(of) his Lord|anyone."
Kaaf Ha Ya Ain Sad.
(A) mention|(of the) Mercy|(of) your Lord|(to) His servant|Zakariya
When|he called|(to) his Lord|a call -|secret.
He said,|"My Lord |Indeed, [I]|(have) weakened|my bones,||and flared|(my) head|(with) white,|and not|I have been|in (my) supplication (to) You|my Lord|unblessed.
And indeed, I|[I] fear|the successors|after me,||and is|my wife|barren.|So give|[to] me|from|Yourself|an heir
Who will inherit me|and inherit|from|(the) family|(of) Yaqub.|And make him|my Lord,|pleasing."
"O Zakariya |Indeed, We|[We] give you glad tidings|of a boy|his name|(will be) Yahya,|not|We (have) assigned|[for] it|before||(this) name."
He said,|"My Lord |How|can|I have|a boy,|while is|my wife|barren,|and indeed,|I have reached|of|the old age|extreme?"
He said,|"Thus,|said|your Lord,|'It|(is) easy for Me||and certainly|I (have) created you|before,||while not|you were|anything.'"
He said,|"My Lord |Make|for me|a sign."|He said,|"Your sign|(is) that not|you will speak|(to) the people,|(for) three|nights|sound."
Then he came out|to|his people|from|the prayer chamber,|and he signaled|to them|to|glorify (Allah)|(in) the morning|and (in) the evening.
"O Yahya |Hold|the Scripture|with strength."|And We gave him|[the] wisdom|(when he was) a child
And affection|from|Us|and purity|and he was|righteous
And dutiful|to his parents,|and not|he was|a tyrant|disobedient.
And peace be|upon him|(the) day|he was born|and (the) day|he dies|and (the) day|he will be raised|alive.
And mention|in|the Book|Maryam,|when|she withdrew|from|her family|(to) a place|eastern.
Then she took|from them||a screen.|Then We sent|to her|Our Spirit|then he assumed for her the likeness||(of) a man|well-proportioned.
She said,|"Indeed, I|[I] seek refuge|with the Most Gracious|from you|if|you are|God fearing."
He said,|"Only|I am|a Messenger|(from) your Lord,|that I (may) bestow|on you|a son|pure."
She said,|"How|can be|for me|a son,|when not|has touched me|a man,|and not|I am|unchaste?"
He said,|"Thus;|said|your Lord,|'It|(is) for Me|easy,|and so that We will make him|a sign|for the mankind|and a Mercy|from Us.|And (it) is|a matter|decreed.'"
So she conceived him,|and she withdrew|with him|(to) a place|remote.
Then drove her|the pains of childbirth|to|(the) trunk|(of) the date-palm.|She said,|"O  I wish|I (had) died|before|this|and I was|(in) oblivion,|forgotten."
So cried to her|from|beneath her,|"That (do) not|grieve|verily,|(has) placed|your Lord|beneath you,|a stream.
And shake|towards you|(the) trunk|(of) the date-palm,|it will drop|upon you|fresh dates|ripe.
So eat|and drink|and cool|(your) eyes.|And if|you see|from|human being|anyone|then say,|'Indeed, I|[I] have vowed|to the Most Gracious|a fast,|so not|I will speak|today|(to any) human being.'"
Then she came|with him|(to) her people,|carrying him.|They said,|"O Maryam |Certainly,|you (have) brought|an amazing thing.|
O sister|(of) Harun |Not|was|your father|an evil man,||and not|was|your mother|unchaste."
Then she pointed|to him.|They said,|"How|(can) we speak|(to one) who|is|in|the cradle,|a child?"
He said,|"Indeed, I am|a slave|(of) Allah.|He gave me|the Scripture|and made me|a Prophet.
And He (has) made me|blessed|wherever||I am|and has enjoined (on) me|[of] the prayer|and zakah,|as long as I am||alive
And dutiful|to my mother,|and not|He (has) made me|insolent,|unblessed.
And peace (be)|on me|(the) day|I was born|and (the) day|I will die|and (the) Day|I will be raised|alive."
That|(was) Isa,|(the) son|(of) Maryam,|a statement|(of) truth|that which|about it|they dispute.
Not|(it) is|for Allah|that|He should take|any son.||Glory be to Him |When|He decrees|a matter,|then only|He says|to it,|"Be"|and it is.
"And indeed,|Allah|(is) my Lord|and your Lord,|so worship Him.|This|(is) a path|straight."
But differed|the sects|from among them,||so woe|to those who|disbelieve|from|(the) witnessing|(of) a Day|great.
How they will hear ||and how (they will) see |(the) Day|they will come to Us,|but|the wrongdoers|today|(are) in|error|clear.
And warn them|(of the) Day|(of) the Regret,|when|has been decided|the matter.|And they|(are) in|heedlessness,|and they|(do) not|believe.
Indeed, We|[We]|[We] will inherit|the earth|and whoever|(is) on it,|and to Us|they will be returned.
And mention|in|the Book|Ibrahim.|Indeed, he|was|a man of truth,|a Prophet.
When|he said|to his father,|"O my father |Why|(do) you worship|that which|not|hears|and not|sees|and not|benefits|[to] you|(in) anything?
O my father |Indeed, [I]|verily|(has) come to me|of|the knowledge|what|not|came to you,|so follow me;|I will guide you|(to) the path|even.
O my father |(Do) not|worship|the Shaitaan.|Indeed,|the Shaitaan|is|to the Most Gracious|disobedient.
O my father |Indeed, I|[I] fear|that|will touch you|a punishment|from|the Most Gracious,|so you would be|to the Shaitaan|a friend."
He said,|"Do you hate||(from)|my gods,|O Ibrahim?|Surely, if|not|you desist|surely, I will stone you,|so leave me|(for) a prolonged time."
He said,|"Peace (be)|on you.|I will ask forgiveness|for you|(from) my Lord.|Indeed, He|is|to me|Ever Gracious.
And I will leave you|and what|you invoke|besides||Allah|and I will invoke|my Lord.|May be|that not|I will be|in invocation|(to) my Lord|unblessed."
So when|he left them|and what|they worshipped|besides Allah,|||[and] We bestowed|[to] him|Ishaq|and Yaqub,|and each (of them)|We made|a Prophet.
And We bestowed|to them|of|Our Mercy,|and We made|for them|a truthful mention,||high.
And mention|in|the Book,|Musa.|Indeed, he|was|chosen|and was|a Messenger,|a Prophet.
And We called him|from|(the) side|(of) the Mount|the right,|and brought him near|(for) conversation.
And We bestowed|[to] him|from|Our Mercy|his brother|Harun,|a Prophet.
And mention|in|the Book,|Ismail.|Indeed, he|was|true|(to his) promise|and was|a Messenger -|a Prophet.
And he used|(to) enjoin|(on) his people|the prayer|and zakah|and was|near|his Lord|pleasing.
And mention|in|the Book,|Idris.|Indeed, he|was|truthful,|a Prophet.
And We raised him|(to) a position|high.
Those|(were) the ones whom|Allah bestowed favor||upon them|from (among)|the Prophets,|of|(the) offspring|(of) Adam,|and of those|We carried|with|Nuh|and of|(the) offspring|(of) Ibrahim|and Israel|and of (those) whom|We guided|and We chose.|When|were recited|to them|(the) Verses|(of) the Most Gracious,|they fell|prostrating|and weeping.
Then succeeded|after them||successors,|who neglected|the prayer|and they followed|the lusts|so soon,|they will meet|evil
Except|(one) who|repented|and believed|and did|good (deeds).|Then those|will enter|Paradise|and not|they will be wronged|(in) anything.
Gardens|(of) Eden,|which|promised|the Most Gracious|(to) His slaves|in the unseen.|Indeed, [it]|is|His promise|sure to come.
Not|they will hear|therein|vain talk|but|peace.|And for them|(is) their provision|therein,|morning|and evening.
This|(is) Paradise,|which|We give (as) inheritance|[of] (to)|Our slaves|(the one) who|is|righteous.
And not|we descend|except|by (the) Command|(of) your Lord.|To Him (belongs)|what|(is) before us||and what|(is) behind us,|and what|(is) between|that.|And not|is|your Lord|forgetful
Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between both of them,|so worship Him|and be constant|in His worship.|Do|you know|for Him|any similarity?
And says|[the] man,|"What  When||I am dead,|surely will|I be brought forth|alive?"
Does not|remember|[the] man|that We,|We created him|before,||while not|he was|anything?
So by your Lord,|surely, We will gather them|and the devils,|then|surely, We will bring them|around|Hell|bent (on) knees.
Then|surely, We will drag out|from|every|sect,|those of them|(who were) worst|against|the Most Gracious|(in) rebellion.
Then|surely, We|know best|[of] those who|[they]|(are) most worthy|therein|(of) being burnt.
And (there is) not|(any) of you|but|(will be) passing over it.|(This) is|upon|your Lord|an inevitability|decreed.
Then|We will deliver|those who|feared (Allah),|and We will leave|the wrongdoers|therein|bent (on) knees.
And when|are recited|to them|Our Verses|clear,|say|those who|disbelieved|to those who|believed,|"Which|(of) the two groups|(is) better|(in) position.|and best|(in) assembly?"
And how many|We destroyed|before them|of|a generation -|they|(were) better|(in) possessions|and appearance?
Say,|"Whoever|is|in|[the] error,|then surely will extend|for him|the Most Gracious|an extension,|until|when|they see|what|they were promised,|either|the punishment|or|the Hour,|then they will know|who|[he]|(is) worst|(in) position|and weaker|(in) forces."
And Allah increases||those who|accept guidance,|(in) guidance.|And the everlasting|good deeds|(are) better|near|your Lord|(for) reward|and better|(for) return.
Then, have you seen|he who|disbelieved|in Our Verses,|and said,|"Surely, I will be given|wealth|and children?"
Has he looked|(into) the unseen,|or|has he taken|from|the Most Gracious|a promise?
Nay,|We will record|what|he says,|and We will extend|for him|from|the punishment|extensively.
And We will inherit (from) him|what|he says,|and he will come to Us|alone.
And they have taken|besides Allah,|||gods,|that they may be|for them|an honor.
Nay,|they will deny|their worship (of them)|and they will be|against them|opponents.
Do not|you see,|that We|[We] have sent|the devils|upon|the disbelievers,|inciting them|(with) incitement.
So (do) not|make haste|against them.|Only|We count|for them|a number.
(The) Day|We will gather|the righteous|to|the Most Gracious|(as) a delegation
And We will drive|the criminals|to|Hell|thirsty.
Not|they will have the power|(of) the intercession|except|(he) who|has taken|from|the Most Gracious|a covenant.
And they say,|"Has taken|the Most Gracious|a son."
Verily,|you have put forth|a thing|atrocious.
Almost|the heavens|get torn|therefrom,|and splits asunder|the earth|and collapse|the mountain|(in) devastation
That|they invoke|to the Most Gracious|a son.
And not|is appropriate|for the Most Gracious|that|He should take|a son.
Not|all|who|(are) in|the heavens|and the earth|but|(will) come|(to) the Most Gracious|(as) a slave.
Verily,|He has enumerated them|and counted them,|a counting.
And all of them|(will) come (to) Him|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|alone.
Indeed,|those who|believed|and did|good deeds,|will bestow|for them|the Most Gracious|affection.
So, only|We (have) made it easy|in your tongue,|that you may give glad tidings|with it|(to) the righteous|and warn|with it|a people|hostile.
And how many|We (have) destroyed|before them|of|a generation?|Can|you perceive|of them|any|one|or|hear|from them|a sound?
Ta Ha.
Not|We (have) sent down|to you|the Quran|that you be distressed
(But)|(as) a reminder|for (those) who|fear
A revelation|from (He) Who|created|the earth|and the heavens|[the] high,
The Most Gracious|over|the Throne|is established.
To Him (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth,|and whatever|(is) between them|and whatever|(is) under|the soil.
And if|you speak aloud|the word,|then indeed, He|knows|the secret|and the more hidden.
Allah -|(there is) no|god|except|Him.|To Him (belongs)|the Names,|the Most Beautiful.
And has|come to you|the narration|(of) Musa?
When|he saw|a fire,|then he said|to his family,|"Stay here;|indeed, I|[I] perceived|a fire;|perhaps I (can)|bring you|therefrom|a burning brand,|or|I find|at|the fire|guidance."
Then when|he came to it,|he was called,|"O Musa,
Indeed, [I]|I Am|your Lord,|so remove|your shoes.|Indeed, you|(are) in the valley|the sacred|(of) Tuwa.
And I|(have) chosen you,|so listen|to what|is revealed.
Indeed, [I]|I Am|Allah.|(There is) no|god|but|I,|so worship Me|and establish|the prayer|for My remembrance.
Indeed,|the Hour|(will be) coming.|I almost|[I] hide it|that may be recompensed|every|soul|for what|it strives.
So (do) not|(let) avert you|from it|(one) who|(does) not|believe|in it|and follows|his desires,|lest you perish.
And what|(is) that|in your right hand,|O Musa?"
He said,|"It|(is) my staff;|I lean|upon it,|and I bring down leaves|with it|for|my sheep,|and for me|in it|(are) uses|other."
He said,|"Throw it down,|O Musa "
So he threw it down,|and behold |It|(was) a snake,|moving swiftly.
He said,|"Seize it|and (do) not|fear.|We will return it|(to) its state|the former.
And draw near|your hand|to|your side;|it will come out|white,|without any||disease|(as) a sign|another.
That We may show you|of|Our Signs|the Greatest.
Go|to|Firaun.|Indeed, he|(has) transgressed."
He said,|"My Lord |Expand|for me|my breast
And ease|for me|my task
And untie|(the) knot|from|my tongue
That they may understand|my speech.
And appoint|for me|a minister|from|my family.
Harun,|my brother.
Reinforce|through him|my strength.
And make him share|[in]|my task
That|we may glorify You|much
And [we] remember You|much.
Indeed, [You]|You are|of us|All-Seer."
He said,|"Verily,|you are granted|your request,|O Musa 
And indeed,|We conferred a favor|on you|another time,|
When|We inspired|to|your mother|what|is inspired,
'That|cast him|in|the chest|then cast it|in|the river,|then let cast it|the river|on the bank;|will take him|an enemy|to Me,|and an enemy|to him.'|And I cast|over you|love|from Me,|and that you may be brought up|under|My Eye.
When|was going|your sister|and she said,|'Shall,|I show you|[to]|(one) who|will nurse and rear him?'|So We returned you|to|your mother|that|may be cooled|her eyes|and not|she grieves.|And you killed|a man,|but We saved you|from|the distress,|and We tried you|(with) a trial.|Then you remained|(some) years|with|(the) people|(of) Madyan.|Then|you came|at|the decreed (time)|O Musa 
And I (have) chosen you|for Myself.
Go,|you|and your brother|with My Signs,|and (do) not|slacken|in|My remembrance.
Go, both of you,|to|Firaun.|Indeed, he|(has) transgressed.
And speak|to him|a word|gentle,|perhaps he|may take heed|or|fear."
They said,|"Our Lord |Indeed, we|fear|that|he will hasten|against us|or|that|he will transgress."
He said,|"(Do) not|fear.|Indeed, I Am|with you both;|I hear|and I see.
So go to him|and say,|'Indeed, we|both (are) Messengers|(of) your Lord,|so send|with us|(the) Children of Israel,||and (do) not|torment them.|Verily,|we came to you|with a Sign|from|your Lord.|And peace|on|(one) who|follows|the Guidance.
Indeed, we|verily,|it has been revealed|to us|that|the punishment|(will be) on|(one) who|denies|and turns away.'"
He said,|"Then who|(is) your Lord,|O Musa?"
He said,|"Our Lord|(is) the One Who|gave|(to) every|thing|its form,|then|He guided (it)."
He said,|"Then what|(is the) case|(of) the generations|(of) the former."
He said,|"Its knowledge|(is) with|my Lord,|in|a Record.|Not|errs|my Lord|and not|forgets."
The One Who|made|for you|the earth|(as) a bed|and inserted|for you|therein|ways,|and sent down|from|the sky|water,|then We (have) brought forth|with it,|pairs|of|plants|diverse.
Eat|and pasture|your cattle.|Indeed,|in|that,|surely (are) Signs|for possessors|(of) intelligence.
From it|We created you,|and in it|We will return you,|and from it|We will bring you out,|time|another.
And verily,|We showed him|Our Signs,|all of them,|but he denied|and refused.
He said,|"Have you come to us|to drive us out|of|our land|with your magic,|O Musa?
Then we will surely produce for you|magic|like it.|So make|between us|and between you|an appointment,|not|we will fail it|[we]|and not|you,|(in) a place|even."
He said,|"Your appointment|(is on the) day|(of) the festival,|and that|will be assembled|the people|(at) forenoon."
Then went away|Firaun|and put together|his plan,|then|came.
Said|to them|Musa,|"Woe to you |(Do) not|invent|against|Allah|a lie,|lest He will destroy you|with a punishment.|And verily,|he failed|who|invented."
Then they disputed|(in) their affair|among them,|and they kept secret|the private conversation.
They said,|"Indeed,|these two|[two] magicians|they intend|that|they drive you out|of|your land|with their magic|and do away|with your way|the exemplary.
So put together|your plan|then|come|(in) a line.|And verily,|(will be) successful|today|who|overcomes."
They said,|"O Musa |Either|[that]|you throw|or|[that]|we will be|the first|who|throws?"
He said,|"Nay,|you throw."|Then behold |Their ropes|and their staffs|seemed|to him|by|their magic|that they|(were) moving.
So sensed|in|himself|a fear,|Musa.
We said,|"(Do) not|fear.|Indeed, you|you|(will be) superior.
And throw|what|(is) in|your right hand;|it will swallow up|what|they have made.|Only|they (have) made|a trick|(of) a magician|and not|will be successful|the magician|wherever|he comes."
So were thrown down|the magicians|prostrating.|They said,|"We believe|in (the) Lord|(of) Harun|and Musa."
He said,|"You believe|[to] him|before|[that]|I gave permission|to you.|Indeed, he|(is) your chief,|the one who|taught you|the magic.|So surely I will cut off|your hands|and your feet|of|opposite sides,|and surely I will crucify you|on|(the) trunks|(of) date-palms|and surely you will know|which of us|(is) more severe|(in) punishment|and more lasting."
They said,|"Never|we will prefer you|over|what|has come to us|of|the clear proofs,|and the One Who|created us.|So decree|whatever|you|(are) decreeing.|Only|you can decree|(for) this|life|(of) the world.
Indeed, [we]|we believe|in our Lord|that He may forgive|for us|our sins|and what|you compelled us|on it|of|the magic.|And Allah|(is) Best|and Ever Lasting."
Indeed, he|who|comes|(to) his Lord|(as) a criminal|then indeed,|for him|(is) Hell.|Not|he will die|in it|and not|live.
But whoever|comes to Him|(as) a believer|verily,|he has done|the righteous deeds,|then those|for them|(will be) the ranks,|[the] high.
Gardens|(of) Eden|flows|from|underneath them|the rivers,|abiding forever|in it.|And that|(is) the reward|(for him) who|purifies himself.
And verily,|We inspired|to|Musa|that,|"Travel by night|with My slaves|and strike|for them|a path|in|the sea|dry;|not|fearing|to be overtaken|and not|being afraid."
Then followed them|Firaun|with his forces,|but covered them|from|the sea|what|covered them
And led astray|Firaun|his people|and (did) not|guide them.
O Children of Israel ||Verily,|We delivered you|from|your enemy,|and We made a covenant with you|on (the) side|(of) the Mount|the right,|and We sent down|to you|the Manna|and the quails.
Eat|of|(the) good things|which|We have provided you|and (do) not|transgress|therein,|lest should descend|upon you|My Anger.|And whoever|on whom descends||My Anger,|indeed,|he (has) perished.
But indeed, I Am|the Perpetual Forgiver|of whoever|repents|and believes|and does|righteous (deeds)|then|remains guided.
"And what|made you hasten|from|your people,|O Musa?"
He said,|"They|(are) close|upon|my tracks,|and I hastened|to you|my Lord,|that You be pleased."
He said,|"But indeed, We|[verily]|We (have) tried|your people|after you||and has led them astray|the Samiri."
Then Musa returned||to|his people|angry|(and) sorrowful.|He said,|"O my people |Did not|promise you|your Lord|a promise|good?|Then, did seem long|to you|the promise,|or|did you desire|that|descend|upon you|(the) Anger|of|your Lord,|so you broke|(the) promise to me?"
They said,|"Not|we broke|promise to you|by our will,|but we|[we] were made to carry|burdens|from|ornaments|(of) the people,|so we threw them|and thus|threw|the Samiri."
Then he brought forth|for them|a calf's|body|it had|a lowing sound,|and they said,|"This|(is) your god|and the god|(of) Musa,|but he forgot."
Then, did not|they see|that not|it (could) return|to them|a word|and not|possess|for them|any harm|and not|any benefit?
And verily|(had) said|to them|Harun|before,||"O my people |Only|you are being tested|by it,|and indeed,|your Lord|(is) the Most Gracious,|so follow me|and obey|my order."
They said,|"Never|we will cease|being devoted to it||until|returns|to us|Musa."
He said,|"O Harun |What|prevented you,|when|you saw them|going astray,
That not|you follow me?|Then, have you disobeyed|my order?"
He said,|"O son of my mother |(Do) not|seize (me)|by my beard|and not|by my head.|Indeed, I|[I] feared|that|you would say,|'You caused division|between|(the) Children of Israel||and not|you respect|my word.'"
He said,|"Then what|(is) your case,|O Samiri?"
He said,|"I perceived|what|not|they perceive,|in it,|so I took|a handful|from|(the) track|(of) the Messenger|then threw it,|and thus|suggested|to me|my soul."
He said,|"Then go.|And indeed,|for you|in|the life|that|you will say,|'(Do) not|touch.'|And indeed,|for you|(is) an appointment|never|you will fail to (keep) it.|And look|at|your god|that which|you have remained|to it|devoted.|Surely we will burn it|then|certainly we will scatter it|in|the sea|(in) particles."
Only|your God|(is) Allah|the One,|(there is) no|god|but|He.|He has encompassed|all|things|(in) knowledge.
Thus|We relate|to you|from|(the) news|(of) what|has preceded.||And certainly|We have given you|from|Us|a Reminder.
Whoever|turns away|from it,|then indeed, he|will bear|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection|a burden.
Abiding forever|in it,|and evil|for them|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|(as) a load
(The) Day|will be blown|in|the Trumpet,|and We will gather|the criminals,|that Day,|blue- eyed.
They are murmuring|among themselves,|"Not|you remained|except (for)|ten."
We|know best|what|they will say|when|will say,|(the) best of them|(in) conduct,|"Not|you remained|except (for)|a day."
And they ask you|about|the mountains,|so say,|"Will blast them|my Lord|(into) particles.
Then He will leave it,|a level|plain.
Not|you will see|in it|any crookedness|and not|any curve."
On that Day|they will follow|the caller,|no|deviation|from it.|And (will be) humbled|the voices|for the Most Gracious,|so not|you will hear|except|a faint sound.
(On) that Day|not|will benefit|the intercession|except|(to) whom|has given permission|[to him]|the Most Gracious,|and He has accepted|for him|a word.
He knows|what|(is) before them||and what|(is) behind them,|while not|they encompass|it|(in) knowledge.
And (will be) humbled|the faces|before the Ever-Living,|the Self-Subsisting.|And verily|will have failed|(he) who|carried|wrongdoing.
But (he) who|does|of|the righteous deeds|while he|(is) a believer,|then not|he will fear|injustice|and not|deprivation.
And thus|We have sent it down,|(the) Quran|(in) Arabic|and We have explained|in it|of|the warnings|that they may|fear|or|it may cause|[for] them|remembrance.
So high (above all)|(is) Allah|the King,|the True.|And (do) not|hasten|with the Quran|before||[that]|is completed|to you|its revelation,|and say,|"My Lord |Increase me|(in) knowledge."
And verily|We made a covenant|with|Adam|before,||but he forgot;|and not|We found|in him|determination.
And when|We said|to the Angels,|"Prostrate|to Adam,"|then they prostrated,|except|Iblis;|he refused.
Then We said,|"O Adam |Indeed,|this|(is) an enemy|to you|and to your wife.|So not|(let) him drive you both|from|Paradise|so (that) you would suffer.
Indeed,|for you|that not|you will be hungry|therein|and not|you will be unclothed.
And that you|not|will suffer from thirst|therein|and not|exposed to the sun's heat."
Then whispered|to him|Shaitaan,|he said,|"O Adam |Shall|I direct you|to|(the) tree|(of) the Eternity|and a kingdom|not|(that will) deteriorate?"
Then they both ate|from it,|so became apparent|to them|their shame|and they began,|(to) fasten|on themselves|from|(the) leaves|(of) Paradise.|And Adam disobeyed||his Lord,|and erred.
Then|chose him|his Lord,|and turned|to him|and guided (him).
He said,|"Go down|from it|all,|some of you|to others|(as) enemy.|Then if|comes to you|from Me|guidance|then whoever,|follows|My guidance,|then not|he will go astray|and not|suffer.
And whoever|turns away|from|My remembrance,|then indeed,|for him|(is) a life|straitened|and We will gather him|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|blind."
He will say,|"My Lord |Why|You raised me|blind|while [verily]|I had|sight."
He will say,|"Thus|came to you|Our Signs,|but you forgot them,|and thus|today|you will be forgotten."
And thus|We recompense|(he) who|transgresses,|and not|believes|in (the) Signs|(of) his Lord.|And surely (the) punishment|(of) the Hereafter|(is) more severe|and more lasting.
Then has not|it guided|[for] them|how many|We (have) destroyed|before them,|of|the generations,|(as) they walk|in|their dwellings?|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for possessors|(of) intelligence.
And if not|(for) a Word|(that) preceded|from|your Lord,|surely (would) have been|an obligation|and a term|determined.
So be patient|over|what|they say|and glorify|with praise|(of) your Lord|before|(the) rising|(of) the sun|and before|its setting;|and from|(the) hours|(of) the night,|and glorify|(at the) ends|(of) the day|so that you may|be satisfied.
And (do) not|extend|your eyes|towards|what|We have given for enjoyment|[with it],|pairs|of them|(the) splendor|(of) the life|(of) the world,|that We may test them|in it.|And (the) provision|(of) your Lord|(is) better|and more lasting.
And enjoin|(on) your family|the prayer|and be steadfast|therein.|Not|We ask you|(for) provision;|We|provide (for) you,|and the outcome|(is) for the righteous[ness].
And they say,|"Why not|he brings us|a sign|from|his Lord?"|Has not|come to them|evidence|(of) what|(was) in|the Scriptures|the former?
And if|We|(had) destroyed them|with a punishment|before him,||surely they (would) have said,|"Our Lord,|why not|You sent|to us|a Messenger,|so we (could) have followed|Your Signs|before||[that]|we were humiliated|and disgraced."
Say,|"Each|(is) waiting;|so await.|Then you will know|who|(are the) companions|(of) the way|[the] even,|and who|is guided."
(Has) approached|for [the] mankind|their account,|while they|(are) in|heedlessness|turning away.
Not|comes to them|of|a Reminder|from|their Lord,|anew|except|they listen to it|while they|(are at) play
Distracted|their hearts.|And they conceal|the private conversation,|those who|[they] wronged,|"Is|this|except|a human being|like you?|So would you approach|the magic|while you|see (it)?"
He said,|"My Lord|knows|the word|in|the heavens|and the earth.|And He|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Knower."
Nay,|they say,|"Muddled|dreams;|nay,|he (has) invented it;|nay,|he|(is) a poet.|So let him bring us|a sign|like what|was sent|(to) the former."
Not|believed|before them|any|town|which We destroyed,|so will they|believe?
And not|We sent|before you|except|men,|We revealed|to them.|So ask|(the) people|(of) the Reminder,|if|you|(do) not|know.
And not|We made them|bodies|not|eating|the food,|and not|they were|immortals.
Then|We fulfilled (for) them|the promise,|and We saved them|and whom|We willed|and We destroyed|the transgressors.
Indeed,|We (have) sent down|to you|a Book|in it|(is) your mention.|Then will not|you use reason?
And how many|We (have) shattered|of|a town|(that) was|unjust,|and We produced|after them|another people.|
Then when|they perceived|Our torment,|behold,|they|from it|were fleeing.
Flee not,||but return|to|what|you were given luxury|in it|and to your homes,|so that you may|be questioned.
They said,|"O woe to us |Indeed, [we]|we were|wrongdoers."
Then not|ceased|[this]|their cry|until|We made them|reaped|extinct.
And not|We created|the heavens|and the earth|and what|(is) between them|(for) playing.
If|We intended|that|We take|a pastime,|surely We (could have) taken it|from|Us,|if|We were|doers.
Nay,|We hurl|the truth|against|[the] falsehood,|and it breaks its head,|behold,|it (is)|vanishing.|And for you|(is) destruction|for what|you ascribe.
And to Him (belongs)|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|And (those) who|(are) near Him|not|they are arrogant|to|worship Him|and not|they tire.
They glorify (Him)|[the] night|and [the] day,|not|they slacken.
Or|(have) they taken|gods|from|the earth,|they|raise (the dead)?
If|(there) were|in both of them|gods|besides|Allah,|surely they (would) have been ruined.|So glorified|(is) Allah,|Lord|(of) the Throne|(above) what|they attribute.
Not|He (can) be questioned|about what|He does,|but they|will be questioned.
Or|(have) they taken|besides Him||gods?|Say,|"Bring|your proof.|This|(is) a Reminder|(for those) who|(are) with me,|and a Reminder|(for those) who|(were) before me."|But|most of them|(do) not|know|the truth|so they|(are) averse.
And not|We sent|before you||any|Messenger|but|We reveal(ed)|to him|that [He],|"(There is) no|god|except|Me,|so worship Me."
And they say,|"Has taken|the Most Gracious|a son."|Glorified is He |Nay,|(they are) slaves|honored.
Not|they (can) precede Him|in word,|and they|by His command|act.
He knows|what|(is) before them,||and what|(is) behind them,|and not|they (can) intercede|except|for whom|He approves.|And they,|from|fear of Him,|stand in awe.
And whoever|says|of them,|"Indeed, I am|a god|besides Him."||Then that|We will recompense|(with) Hell.|Thus|We recompense|the wrongdoers.
Do not|see|those who|disbelieved|that|the heavens|and the earth|were|a joined entity,|then We parted them|and We made|from|[the] water|every|living thing?||Then will not|they believe?
And We (have) placed|in|the earth|firmly set mountains,|lest|it (should) shake|with them,|and We made|therein|broad passes|(as) ways,|so that they may|(be) guided.
And We made|the sky|a roof|protected.|But they,|from|its Signs,|turn away.
And He|(is) the One Who|created|the night|and the day,|and the sun|and the moon;|each|in|an orbit|floating.
And not|We made|for any man|before you||[the] immortality;|so if|you die,|then (would) they|live forever?
Every|soul|(will) taste|[the] death.|And We test you|with [the] bad|and [the] good|(as) a trial;|and to Us|you will be returned.
And when|you see|those who|disbelieve|not|they take you|except|(in) ridicule,|"Is this|the one who|mentions|your gods?"|And they|at (the) mention|(of) the Most Gracious|[they]|(are) disbelievers.
Is created|the man|of|haste.|I will show you|My Signs|so (do) not|ask Me to hasten.
And they say,|"When (will be fulfilled)|this|promise,|if|you are|truthful?"
If|knew|those who|disbelieved|(the) time|(when) not|they will avert|from|their faces|the Fire|and not|from|their backs|and not|they|will be helped 
Nay,|it will come to them|unexpectedly|and bewilder them,|then not|they will be able|to repel it,|and not|they|will be given respite.
And verily,|were mocked|Messengers|before you||then surrounded|those who|mocked|from them|what|they used|at it|(to) mock.
Say,|"Who|(can) protect you|in the night|and the day|from|the Most Gracious?"|Yet,|they|from|(the) remembrance|(of) their Lord|turn away.
Or|have they|gods|(to) defend them|from|Us?|Not|they are able|(to) help|themselves|and not|they|from Us|can be protected.
Nay,|We gave provision|(to) these|and their fathers|until|grew long|for them,|the life.|Then do not|they see|that We|We come|(to) the land,|We reduce it|from|its borders?|So is (it) they|(who will be) overcoming?
Say,|"Only|I warn you|by the revelation."|But not|hear|the deaf|the call|when||they are warned.
And if|touches them|a whiff|of|(the) punishment|(of) your Lord,|surely they will say,|"O woe to us |Indeed, we|[we] were|wrongdoers."
And We set|the scales|(of) the justice|for (the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|so not|will be wronged|any soul|(in) anything.|And if|(there) be|weight|(of) a seed|of|a mustard|We will bring|[with] it.|And sufficient|(are) We|(as) Reckoners.
And verily,|We gave|Musa|and Harun|the Criterion|and a light|and a Reminder|for the righteous.
Those who|fear|their Lord|in the unseen,|and they|of|the Hour|(are) afraid.
And this|(is) a Reminder|blessed,|which We (have) revealed.|Then are you|of it|rejecters?
And verily,|We gave|Ibrahim|his guidance|before,||and We were|about him|Well-Knowing.
When|he said|to his father|and his people,|"What|(are) these|[the] statues|which|you|to it|(are) devoted?"
They said,|"We found|our forefathers|of them|worshippers."
He said,|"Verily,|you (are)|[you]|and your forefathers|(were) in|an error|manifest."
They said,|"Have you come to us|with the truth,|or|you|(are) of|those who play?"
He said,|"Nay,|your Lord|(is the) Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|the One Who|created them|and I am|to|that|of|the witnesses.
And by Allah|surely, I will plan|(against) your idols|after|[that]|you go away|turning (your) backs."
So he made them|(into) pieces|except|a large (one)|of them,|so that they may|to it|return.
They said,|"Who|(has) done|this|to our gods?|Indeed, he|(is) of|the wrongdoers."
They said,|"We heard|a youth|mention them|he is called||Ibrahim."
They said,|"Then bring|him|before|(the) eyes|(of) the people|so that they may|bear witness."
They said,|"Have you|done|this|to our gods|O Ibrahim?"
He said,|"Nay,|(some doer) did it.|Their chief|(is) this.|So ask them|if|they (can)|speak."
So they returned|to|themselves|and said,|"Indeed, you|[you]|(are) the wrongdoers."
Then|they were turned|on|their heads,|"Verily,|you know|not|these|(can) speak "
He said,|"Then do you worship|besides||Allah|what|(does) not|benefit you|(in) anything|and not|harms you?
Uff|to you|and to what|you worship|besides||Allah.|Then will not|you use reason?"
They said,|"Burn him|and support|your gods,|if|you are|doers."
We said,|"O fire |Be|cool[ness]|and safe[ty]|for|Ibrahim."
And they intended|for him,|a plan|but We made them|the greatest losers.
And We delivered him|and Lut|to|the land|which|We (had) blessed|[in it]|for the worlds.
And We bestowed|on him|Ishaq|and Yaqub|(in) addition,|and all|We made|righteous.
And We made them|leaders,|they guide|by Our Command.|And We inspired|to them|(the) doing|(of) good deeds,|and establishment|(of) the prayer|and giving|(of) zakah;|and they were|of Us|worshippers.
And (to) Lut|We gave him|judgment|and knowledge,|and We saved him|from|the town|which|was|doing|wicked deeds.|Indeed, they|were|a people|evil,|defiantly disobedient.
And We admitted him|into|Our Mercy.|Indeed, he|(was) of|the righteous.
And Nuh,|when|he called|before,||so We responded|to him|and We saved him|and his family|from|the affliction,|[the] great.
And We helped him|from|the people|who|denied|Our Signs.|Indeed, they|were|a people|evil,|so We drowned them|all.
And Dawud|and Sulaiman,|when|they judged|concerning|the field,|when|pastured|in it|sheep|(of) a people,|and We were|to their judgment|witness.
And  We gave understanding of it|(to) Sulaiman,|and (to) each|We gave|judgment|and knowledge.|And We subjected|with|Dawud|the mountains|(to) glorify Our praises|and the birds.|And We were|the Doers.
And We taught him|(the) making|(of) coats of armor|for you|to protect you|from|your battle.|Then will|you|(be) grateful?
And to Sulaiman,|the wind|forcefully|blowing|by his command|to|the land|which|We blessed|[in it].|And We are|of every|thing|Knowers.
And of|the devils|(were some) who|would dive|for him|and would do|work|other than|that.|And We were|of them|Guardians.
And Ayub,|when|he called|(to) his Lord,|"Indeed, [I]|has touched me|the adversity,|and You|(are) Most Merciful|(of) the Merciful."
So We responded|to him|and We removed|what|(was) on him|of|(the) adversity.|And We gave him|his family|and (the) like thereof|with them|(as) Mercy|from Ourselves,||and a reminder|for the worshippers.
And Ismail|and Idris|and Dhul-Kifl;||all|(were) of|the patient ones.
And We admitted them|in|Our Mercy.|Indeed, they|(were) of|the righteous.
And Dhun-Nun||when|he went|(while) angry|and thought|that|never|We would decree|upon him.|Then he called|in|the darkness(es)|that,|"(There is) no|god|except|You,|Glory be to You |Indeed, [I]|I am|of|the wrongdoers."
So We responded|to him,|and We saved him|from|the distress.|And thus|We save|the believers.
And Zakariya,|when|he called|(to) his Lord,|"My Lord |(Do) not|leave me|alone,|while You|(are) [the] Best|(of) the inheritors."
So We responded|to him,|and We bestowed|on him|Yahya,|and We cured|for him|his wife.|Indeed, they|used (to)|hasten|in|good deeds,|and they supplicate to Us|(in) hope|and fear,|and they were|to Us|humbly submissive.
And she who|guarded|her chastity,|so We breathed|into her|of|Our Spirit,|and  We made her|and her son|a sign|for the worlds.
Indeed,|this|(is) your religion -|religion|one,|and I Am|your Lord,|so worship Me.
But they cut off|their affair|among themselves,|all|to Us|(will) return.
Then whoever|does|[of]|[the] righteous deeds|while he|(is) a believer|then not|(will be) rejected|[of] his effort.|And indeed, We|of it|(are) Recorders.
And (there is) prohibition|upon|a city|which We have destroyed,|that they|not|will return.
Until|when|has been opened|(for) the Yajuj|and Majuj,|and they|from|every|elevation|descend.
And has approached|the promise|[the] true|then behold,|[it]|(are) staring|(the) eyes|(of) those who|disbelieved,|"O woe to us |Verily,|we had been|in|heedlessness|of|this;|nay,|we were|wrongdoers."
Indeed, you|and what|you worship|besides Allah|||(are) firewood|(of) Hell.|You|to it|will come.
If|were|these|gods,|not|they (would) have come to it.|And all|therein|will abide forever.
For them|therein|(is) sighing,|and they|therein|not|will hear.
Indeed,|those|has gone forth|for them|from Us|the good,|those|from it|(will be) removed far.
Not|they will hear|(the) slightest sound of it|and they|in|what|desire|their souls|will abide forever.
Not|will grieve them|the terror|[the] greatest,|and will meet them|the Angels,|"This|(is) your Day|which|you were|promised."
(The) Day|We will fold|the heaven|like (the) folding|(of) a scroll|for records.|As|We began|(the) first|creation|We will repeat it,|a promise|upon Us.|Indeed, We -|We are|(the) Doers.
And verily,|We have written|in|the Scripture|after||the mention,|that|the earth -|will inherit it|My slaves,|the righteous.
Indeed,|in|this|surely is a Message|for a people,|worshippers.
And not|We have sent you|but|(as) a mercy|for the worlds.
Say,|"Only|it is revealed|to me|that|your god|(is) God|One;|so will|you|submit (to Him)?"
But if|they turn away|then say,|"I (have) announced to you|equally.||And not|I know|whether is near|or|far|what|you are promised.
Indeed, He|knows|the declared|[of]|[the] speech|and He knows|what|you conceal.
And not|I know,|perhaps it may be|a trial|for you,|and an enjoyment|for|a time."
He said,|"My Lord |judge|in truth.|And our Lord|(is) the Most Gracious,|the One Whose help is sought|against|what|you attribute."
O mankind ||Fear|your Lord.|Indeed,|(the) convulsion|(of) the Hour|(is) a thing|great.
(The) Day|you will see it,|will forget|every|nursing mother|that which|she was nursing,|and will deliver|every|pregnant woman||her load,|and you will see|[the] mankind|intoxicated,|while not|they|(are) intoxicated;|but|(the) punishment|(of) Allah|(will be) severe.
And among|the mankind|(is he) who|disputes|concerning|Allah|without|knowledge|and follows|every|devil|rebellious.
It has been decreed|for him|that he|who|befriends him,|then indeed, he|will misguide him|and will guide him|to|(the) punishment|(of) the Blaze.
O mankind ||If|you are|in|doubt|about|the Resurrection,|then indeed, We|We created you|from|dust,|then|from|a semen-drop,|then|from|a clinging substance|then|from|an embryonic lump,|formed|and unformed,||that We may make clear|to you.|And We cause to remain|in|the wombs|what|We will|for|a term|appointed,|then|We bring you out|(as) a child,|[then]|that you may reach|[your] maturity.|And among you|(is he) who|dies,|and among you|(is he) who|is returned|to|the most abject|age,|so that not|he knows,|after||having known,|anything.|And you see|the earth|barren|then when|We send down|on it|water,|it gets stirred|and it swells|and grows|of|every|kind|beautiful.
That|(is) because,|Allah -|He|(is) the Truth.|And that He|[He] gives life|(to) the dead,|and that He|(is) over|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And that|the Hour|will come,|(there is) no|doubt|about it,|and that|Allah|will resurrect|(those) who|(are) in|the graves.
And among|mankind|(is he) who|disputes|concerning|Allah|without|any knowledge|and not|any guidance|and not|a Book|enlightening,
Twisting|his neck|to mislead|from|(the) way|(of) Allah.|For him|in|the world|(is) disgrace,|and We will make him taste|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection|(the) punishment|(of) the Burning Fire.
"That|(is) for what|have sent forth|your hands,|and that|Allah|is not|unjust|to His slaves."
And among|the mankind|(is he) who|worships|Allah|on|an edge.|And if|befalls him|good,|he is content|with it,|and if|befalls him|a trial|he turns|on|his face.|He has lost|the world|and the Hereafter.|That|[it]|(is) the loss|clear.
He calls|besides||Allah|what|not|harms him|and what|not|benefits him.|That|[it]|(is) the straying|far away.
He calls|(one) who -|his harm|(is) closer|than|his benefit.|Surely, an evil|protector|and surely an evil|friend 
Indeed,|Allah|will admit|those who|believe|and do|the righteous deeds|(to) Gardens|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers.|Indeed,|Allah|does|what|He intends
Whoever|[is]|thinks|that|not|Allah will help him||in|the world|and the Hereafter,|then let him extend|a rope|to|the sky,|then|let him cut off,|then let him see|whether|will remove|his plan|what|enrages.
And thus|We sent it down|(as) clear Verses,||and that|Allah|guides|whom|He intends.
Indeed,|those who|have believed,|and those who|were Jews|and the Sabians|and the Christians|and the Majus,|and those who|(are) polytheists|indeed,|Allah|will judge|between them|(on) the Day|(of) the Resurrection.|Indeed,|Allah|over|every|thing|(is) a Witness.
Do not|you see|that|Allah  -|prostrates|to Him|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and whoever|(is) in|the earth,|and the sun|and the moon|and the stars|and the mountains,|and the trees|and the moving creatures|and many|of|the people?|But many -|(is) justly due|on him|the punishment.|And whoever|Allah humiliates||then not|for him|any|bestower of honor.|Indeed,|Allah|does|what|He wills.
These two|opponents|dispute|concerning|their Lord.|But those who|disbelieved|will be cut out|for them|garments|of|fire.|Will be poured|over||their heads|[the] scalding water.
Will be melted|with it|what|(is) in|their bellies|and the skins.
And for them|(are) hooked rods|of|iron.
Every time|they want|to|come out|from it|from|anguish,|they will be returned|therein,|"Taste|(the) punishment|(of) the Burning Fire "
Indeed,|Allah|will admit|those who|believe|and do|the righteous deeds,|(to) Gardens|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers.|They will be adorned|therein|with|bracelets|of|gold|and pearl,|and their garments|therein|(will be of) silk.
And they were guided|to|the good|of|the speech,|and they were guided|to|(the) path|(of) the Praiseworthy.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved|and hinder|from|(the) way|(of) Allah|and Al-Masjid Al-Haraam,||which|We made it|for the mankind,|equal,|(are) the resident|therein|and the visitor;|and whoever|intends|therein|of deviation|(or) wrongdoing,|We will make him taste|of|a punishment|painful.
And when|We assigned|to Ibrahim|(the) site|(of) the House,|"That|(do) not|associate|with Me|anything|and purify|My House|for those who circumambulate|and those who stand|and those who bow,|(and) those who prostrate.
And proclaim|to|[the] mankind|[of] the Pilgrimage;|they will come to you|(on) foot|and on|every|lean camel;|they will come|from|every|mountain highway|distant.
That they may witness|benefits|for them,|and mention|(the) name|(of) Allah|on|days|known|over|what|He has provided them|of|(the) beast|(of) cattle.|So eat|of them|and feed|the miserable,|the poor.
Then|let them complete|their prescribed duties|and fulfil|their vows,|and circumambulate|the House|[the] Ancient."
That|and whoever|honors|(the) sacred rites|(of) Allah,|then it|(is) best|for him|near|his Lord.|And are made lawful|to you|the cattle|except|what|is recited|to you.|So avoid|the abomination|of|the idols|and avoid|(the) word|false.
Being upright|to Allah,|not|associating partners|with Him.|And whoever|associates partners|with Allah|then (it is) as though|he had fallen|from|the sky|and (had) snatched him|the birds,|or|had blown|him|the wind|to|a place|far off.
That,|and whoever|honors|(the) Symbols|(of) Allah|then indeed, it|(is) from|(the) piety|(of) the hearts.
For you|therein|(are) benefits|for|a term|appointed;|then|their place of sacrifice|(is) at|the House|the Ancient.
And for every|nation|We have appointed|a rite,|that they may mention|(the) name|(of) Allah|over|what|He (has) provided them|of|(the) beast|(of) cattle.|And your God|(is) God|One,|so to Him|submit.|And give glad tidings|(to) the humble ones.
Those|when|is mentioned|Allah -|fear|their hearts,|and those who are patient|over|whatever|has afflicted them,|and those who establish|the prayer,|and out of what|We have provided them|they spend.
And the camels and cattle -|We have made them|for you|among|(the) Symbols|(of) Allah,|for you|therein|(is) good.|So mention|(the) name|(of) Allah|over them|(when) lined up;|and when|are down|their sides,|then eat|from them|and feed|the needy who do not ask|and the needy who ask.|Thus|We have subjected them|to you|so that you may|be grateful.
Will not|reach|Allah|their meat|and not|their blood|but|reaches Him|the piety|from you.|Thus|He subjected them|to you|so that you may magnify|Allah|for|what|He has guided you.|And give glad tidings|(to) the good-doers.
Indeed,|Allah|defends||those who|believe.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|like|every|treacherous|ungrateful.
Permission is given|to those who|are being fought|because they|were wronged.|And indeed,|Allah|for|their victory|(is) surely Able.
Those who|have been evicted|from|their homes|without|right|except|that|they said,|"Our Lord|(is) Allah."|And if not|Allah checks||the people,|some of them|by others|surely (would) have been demolished|monasteries|and churches|and synagogues|and masajid -|is mentioned|in it|(the) name of Allah||much.|And surely Allah will help||(those) who|help Him.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) surely All-Strong,|All-Mighty.
Those who,|if|We establish them|in|the land|they establish|the prayer|and they give|zakah|and they enjoin|the right|and forbid|from|the wrong.|And for Allah|(is the) end|(of) the matters.
And if|they deny you,|so verily|denied|before them|(the) people|(of) Nuh|and Aad|and Thamud,
And (the) people|(of) Ibrahim,|and (the) people|(of) Lut
And the inhabitants|(of) Madyan.|And Musa was denied,||so I granted respite|to the disbelievers,|then|I seized them,|and how|was|My punishment.
And how many|of|a township|We have destroyed it,|while it|was doing wrong,|so it|fell|on|its roofs,|and well|abandoned,|and castle|lofty.
So have not|they traveled|in|the land|and is|for them|hearts|(to) reason|with it|or|ears|(to) hear|with it?|For indeed, [it]|not|(are) blinded|the eyes|but|(are) blinded|the hearts|which|(are) in|the breasts.
And they ask you to hasten|the punishment.|But never will|Allah fail||(in) His Promise.|And indeed,|a day|with|your Lord|(is) like a thousand|year(s)|of what|you count.
And how many|of|a township|I gave respite|to it,|while it|(was) doing wrong.|Then|I seized it|and to Me|(is) the destination.
Say,|"O mankind ||Only|I am|to you|a warner|clear."
So those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds -|for them|(is) forgiveness|and a provision|noble.
And those who|strove|against|Our Verses,|(to) cause failure,|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Hellfire.
And not|We sent|before you||any|Messenger|and not|a Prophet|but|when|he recited,|threw|the Shaitaan|in|his recitation.|But Allah abolishes||what|throws|the Shaitaan,|then|Allah will establish||His Verses.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
That He may make|what|the Shaitaan throws||a trial|for those|in|their hearts|(is) a disease,|and (are) hardened|their hearts.|And indeed,|the wrongdoers|(are) surely, in|schism|far.
And that may know|those who|have been given|the knowledge|that it|(is) the truth|from|your Lord,|and they believe|in it,|and may humbly submit|to it|their hearts.|And indeed,|Allah|(is) surely (the) Guide|(of) those who|believe,|to|a Path|Straight.
And not|will cease|those who|disbelieve|(to be) in|doubt|of it|until|comes to them|the Hour|suddenly|or|comes to them|(the) punishment|(of) a Day|barren.
The Sovereignty|(on) that Day|(will be) for Allah,|He will judge|between them.|So those who|believe|and did|righteous deeds|(will be) in|Gardens|(of) Delight.
And those who|disbelieved|and denied|Our Verses,|then those|for them|(will be) a punishment|humiliating.
And those who|emigrated|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|then|were killed|or|died,|surely, Allah will provide them||a provision|good.|And indeed|Allah,|surely, He|(is the) Best|(of) the Providers.
Surely, He will admit them|(to) an entrance|they will be pleased (with) it.|And indeed,|Allah|surely, (is) All-Knowing,|Most Forbearing.
That,|and whoever|has retaliated,|with the like|(of) that|he was made to suffer|by it,|then|he was oppressed|[on him],|Allah will surely help him.||Indeed,|Allah|(is) surely Oft-Pardoning,|Oft-Forgiving.
That,|(is) because|Allah|causes to enter|the night|in (to)|the day,|and causes to enter|the day|in (to)|the night.|And indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Seer.
That (is),|because|Allah,|He|(is) the Truth,|and that|what|they invoke|besides Him,||it|(is) the falsehood.|And that|Allah,|He|(is) the Most High,|the Most Great.
Do not|you see,|that|Allah|sends down|from|the sky|water|then becomes|the earth|green?|Indeed,|Allah|(is) surely Subtle,|All-Aware.
For Him|(is) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And indeed,|Allah|surely, He|(is) Free of need,|the Praiseworthy.
Do not|you see|that|Allah|(has) subjected|to you|what|(is) in|the earth,|and the ships|that sail|through|the sea|by His Command?|And He withholds|the sky|lest|it falls|on|the earth|except|by His permission.|Indeed,|Allah|to mankind|(is) Full of Kindness,|Most Merciful.
And He|(is) the One Who|gave you life|then|He will cause you to die|then|He will give you life (again).|Indeed,|man|(is) surely ungrateful.
For every|nation|We have made|rite(s),|they|perform it.|So let them not dispute with you||in|the matter,|but invite (them)|to|your Lord.|Indeed, you|(are) surely on|guidance|straight.
And if|they argue (with) you|then say,|"Allah|(is) most knowing|of what|you do.
Allah|will judge|between you|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|concerning what|you used (to)|in it|differ."
Do not|you know|that|Allah|knows|what|(is) in|the heaven|and the earth?|Indeed,|that|(is) in|a Record,|indeed,|that|(is) for|Allah|easy.
And they worship|besides Allah|||what|not|He (has) sent down|for it|any authority,|and what|not|they have|of it|any knowledge.|And not|(will be) for the wrongdoers|any|helper.
And when|are recited|to them|Our Verses|clear,|you will recognize|on|(the) faces|(of) those who|disbelieve|the denial.|They almost|attack|those who|recite|to them|Our Verses.|Say,|"Then shall I inform you|of  worse|than|that?|The Fire,|Allah (has) promised it||(for) those who|disbelieve,|and wretched|(is) the destination."
O mankind ||Is set forth|an example,|so listen|to it.|Indeed,|those whom|you invoke|besides Allah|||will never|create|a fly|even if|they gathered together|for it.|And if|snatched away from them|the fly|a thing|not|they (could) take it back|from it.|So weak|(are) the seeker|and the one who is sought.
Not|they (have) estimated|Allah|(with) due|[His] estimation.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) surely All-Strong,|All-Mighty.
Allah|chooses|from|the Angels|Messengers,|and from|the mankind.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Seer.
He knows|what|(is) before them||and what|(is) after them.|And to|Allah|return|all the matters.
O you who believe |||Bow|and prostrate|and worship|your Lord|and do|[the] good|so that you may|be successful.
And strive|for|Allah|(with the) striving due (to) Him.||He|(has) chosen you|and not|placed|upon you|in|the religion|any|difficulty.|(The) religion|(of) your father|Ibrahim.|He|named you|Muslims|before||and in|this,|that may be|the Messenger|a witness|over you|and you may be|witnesses|on|the mankind.|So establish|the prayer|and give|zakah|and hold fast|to Allah.|He|(is) your Protector -|so an Excellent|[the] Protector|and an Excellent|[the] Helper.
Indeed,|successful|(are) the believers
Those who|[they]|during|their prayers|(are) humbly submissive,
Those who|[they]|from|the vain talk|turn away,
Those who|[they]|of purification works|(are) doers,
And those who|[they]|of their modesty|(are) guardians
Except|from|their spouses|or|what|they rightfully possess||then indeed, they|(are) not|blameworthy.
Then whoever|seeks|beyond|that|then those|[they]|(are) the transgressors.
And those who|[they]|of their trusts|and their promise(s)|(are) observers
And those who|[they]|over|their prayers|they guard
Those|[they]|(are) the inheritors
Who|will inherit|the Paradise.|They|therein|(will) abide forever.
And indeed,|We created|the humankind|from|an essence|of|clay.
Then|We placed him|(as) a semen-drop|in|a resting place|firm.
Then|We created|the semen-drop|(into) a clinging substance,|then We created|the clinging substance|(into) an embryonic lump,|then We created|the embryonic lump,|(into) bones,|then We clothed|the bones|(with) flesh;|then|We produce it|(as) a creation|another.|So blessed is|Allah|(the) Best|(of) the Creators.
Then|indeed, you|after|that|surely (will) die.
Then|indeed, you|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|will be resurrected.
And indeed,|We (have) created|above you|seven|paths|and not|We are|of|the creation|unaware.
And We send down|from|the sky|water,|in (due) measure|then We cause it to settle|in|the earth.|And indeed, We,|on|taking it away,||surely (are) Able.
Then We produced|for you|by it|gardens|of date-palms||and grapevines,|for you,|in it|(are) fruits|abundant|and from them|you eat.
And a tree|(that) springs forth|from|Mount Sinai||(which) produces|oil|and a relish|for those who eat.
And indeed,|for you|in|the cattle|surely, (is) a lesson.|We give you drink|from what|(is) in|their bellies,|and for you|in them|(are) benefits|many|and of them|you eat.
And on them|and on|[the] ships|you are carried.
And verily|We sent|Nuh|to|his people,|and he said,|"O my people |Worship|Allah;|not|for you|(is) any|god|other than Him.|Then will not|you fear?"
But said|the chiefs|(of) those who|disbelieved|among|his people,|"This is not||but|a man|like you,|he wishes|to|assert (his) superiority|over you,|and if|Allah had willed||surely He (would have) sent down|Angels.|Not|we heard|of this|from|our forefathers.|
Not|he|(is) but|a man|in him|(is) madness,|so wait|concerning him|until|a time."
He said,|"My Lord |Help me|because|they deny me."
So We inspired|to him,|"That|construct|the ship|under Our eyes,|and Our inspiration,|then when|comes|Our Command|and gushes forth|the oven,|then put|into it|of|every (kind)|(of) mates|two|and your family,|except|those|(has) preceded|against whom|the Word|thereof.|And (do) not|address Me|concerning|those who|wronged,|indeed, they|(are) the ones to be drowned.
And when|you (have) boarded|you,|and whoever|(is) with you|[on]|the ship|then say,|'Praise|(be) to Allah,|Who|(has) saved us|from|the people -|the wrongdoers.'
And say,|'My Lord,|cause me  to land|(at) a landing place|blessed,|and You|(are) the Best|(of) those who cause to land.'"
Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs,|and indeed,|We are|surely testing.
Then|We produced|after them||a generation|another.
And We sent|among them|a Messenger|from themselves|[that]|"Worship|Allah;|not|for you|(is) any|god|other than Him.|Then will not|you fear?"
And said|the chiefs|of|his people|who|disbelieved|and denied|(the) meeting|(of) the Hereafter,|while We had given them luxury|in|the life|(of) the world,|"Not|(is) this|but|a man|like you.|He eats|of what|you eat|[from it],|and he drinks|of what|you drink.
And surely if|you obey|a man|like you,|indeed, you|then|surely (will be) losers.
Does he promise you -|that you|when|you are dead|and you become|dust|and bones|that you|(will be) brought forth?
Far-(fetched),|far-(fetched)|is what|you are promised 
Not|it|(is) but|our life|(of) the world,|we die|and we live,|and not|we|(will be) resurrected.
Not|(is) he|but|a man|who (has) invented|about|Allah|a lie,|and not|we|(in) him|(are) believers."
He said,|"My Lord |Help me|because|they deny me."
He said,|"After a little while||surely they will become|regretful."
So seized them|the awful cry|in truth,|and We made them|(as) rubbish of dead leaves.|So away|with the people -|the wrongdoers.
Then|We produced|after them||a generation|another.
Not|can precede|any|nation|its term,|and not|they (can) delay (it).
Then|We sent|Our Messengers|(in) succession.|Every time||came|(to) a nation|its Messenger,|they denied him,|so We made (them) follow -|some of them|others,|and We made them|narrations.|So away|with a people -|not|they believe.
Then|We sent|Musa|and his brother|Harun|with Our Signs|and an authority|clear
To|Firaun|and his chiefs,|but they behaved arrogantly|and they were|a people|haughty.
Then they said,|"Shall we believe|(in) two men|like ourselves|while their people|for us|(are) slaves."
So they denied them|and they became|of|those who were destroyed.
And verily,|We gave|Musa|the Scripture|so that they may|be guided.
And We made|(the) son|(of) Maryam|and his mother|a Sign,|and We sheltered them|to|a high ground,|of tranquility||and water springs.
O Messengers ||Eat|of|the good things|and do|righteous (deeds).|Indeed, I Am|of what|you do|All-Knower.
And indeed|this,|your religion,|(is) religion|one.|And I Am|your Lord,|so fear Me.
But they cut off|their affair (of unity)|between them|(into) sects,|each|faction|in what|they have|rejoicing.
So leave them|in|their confusion|until|a time.
Do they think|that what|We extend to them|[with it]|of|wealth|and children
We hasten|to them|in|the good?|Nay,|not|they perceive.
Indeed,|those who|[they]|from|(the) fear|(of) their Lord|(are) cautious.
And those|[they]|in (the) Signs|(of) their Lord|believe
And those|[they]|with their Lord|(do) not|associate partners.
And those who|give|what|they give|while their hearts|(are) fearful,|because they|to|their Lord|(will) return
(It is) those|who hasten|in|the good (deeds)|and they|in them|(are) foremost.
And not|We burden|any soul|except|(to) its capacity,|and with Us|(is) a Record|(which) speaks|with the truth;|and they|(will) not|be wronged.
Nay,|their hearts|(are) in|confusion|over|this,|and for them|(are) deeds|besides||that,|they|for it|(are) doers
Until|when|We seize|their affluent ones|with the punishment,|behold |They|cry for help.
"(Do) not|cry for help|today.|Indeed, you|from Us|not|will be helped.
Verily,|were|My Verses|recited|to you,|but you used|(to) on|your heels|turn back
(Being) arrogant|about it,|conversing by night,|speaking evil."
Then, do not|they ponder|the Word|or|has come to them|what|not|(had) come|(to) their forefathers?|
Or|(do) not|they recognize|their Messenger,|so they|(are) rejecting him?|
Or|they say,|"In him|(is) madness?"|Nay,|he brought them|the truth,|but most of them|to the truth,|(are) averse.
But if|(had) followed|the truth|their desires,|surely (would) have been corrupted|the heavens|and the earth|and whoever|(is) therein.|Nay,|We have brought them|their reminder,|but they,|from|their reminder,|(are) turning away.
Or|you ask them|(for) a payment?|But the payment|(of) your Lord|(is) best,|and He|(is) the Best|(of) the Providers.
And indeed, you|certainly call them|to|(the) Path|Straight.
And indeed,|those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter|from|the path|surely (are) deviating.
And if|We had mercy on them|and  We removed|what|(was) on them|of|(the) hardship,|surely they would persist|in|their transgression|wandering blindly.
And verily|We seized them|with the punishment|but not|they submit|to their Lord|and not|they supplicate humbly
Until|when|We opened|for them|a gate|of a punishment||severe,|behold |They|in it|(will be in) despair.
And He|(is) the One Who|produced|for you|the hearing|and the sight|and the feeling;|little|(is) what|you give thanks.
And He|(is) the One Who|multiplied you|in|the earth|and to Him|you will be gathered.
And He|(is) the One Who|gives life|and causes death|and for Him|(is the) alternation|(of) the night|and the day.|Then will not|you reason?
Nay,|they say|(the) like|(of) what|said|the former (people).
They said,|"What  When|we are dead|and become|dust|and bones,|would we|surely be resurrected?
Verily,|we have been promised|[we]|and our forefathers|this|before;||not|(is) this|but|(the) tales|(of) the former (people)."
Say,|"To whom (belongs)|the earth|and whoever|(is) in it,|if|you|know?"
They will say,|"To Allah."|Say,|"Then will not|you remember?"
Say,|"Who|(is the)  Lord|(of) the seven heavens||and (the) Lord|(of) the Throne|the Great?"
They will say,|"Allah."|Say,|"Then will not|you fear (Him)?"
Say,|Who is (it)|in Whose Hand(s)|(is the) dominion|(of) all|things,|and He|protects|and no (one)|(can) be protected|against Him,|If|you|know?"
They will say,|"Allah."|Say,|"Then how|are you deluded?"
Nay,|We (have) brought them|the truth,|but indeed, they|surely, (are) liars.
Not|Allah has taken||any|son,|and not|is|with Him|any|god.|Then|surely (would have) taken away|each|god|what|he created,|and surely would have overpowered,|some of them|[on]|others.|Glory be|(to) Allah|above what|they attribute 
Knower|(of) the unseen|and the witnessed,|exalted is He|above what|they associate.
Say,|"My Lord |If|You should show me|what|they are promised
My Lord,|then (do) not|place me|among|the people -|the wrongdoers."
And indeed We|on|that|We show you|what|We have promised them|surely able.
Repel|by that|which|(is) best -|the evil.|We|know best|of what|they attribute.
And say,|"My Lord |I seek refuge|in You|from|(the) suggestions|(of) the evil ones,
And I seek refuge|in  You,|My Lord |Lest|they be present with me."
Until|when|comes|(to) one of them|the death|he says,|"My Lord |Send me back
That I may|do|righteous (deeds)|in what|I left behind."|No |Indeed, it|(is) a word|he|speaks it,|and before them||(is) a barrier|till|(the) Day|they are resurrected.
So when|is blown|in|the trumpet|then not|(there) will be relationship|among them|that Day,|and not|will they ask each other.
Then (the one) whose|(are) heavy|his scales,|then those -|they|(are) the successful.
But (the one) whose|(are) light|his scales,|then those|they [who]|have lost|their souls,|in|Hell|they (will) abide forever.
Will burn|their faces|the Fire,|and they|in it|(will) grin with displaced lips.
"Were not||My Verses|recited|to you,|and you used (to)|deny them?"|
They (will) say,|"Our Lord |Overcame|[on] us|our wretchedness,|and we were|a people|astray.
Our Lord |Bring us out|from it,|then if|we return|then indeed, we|(would be) wrongdoers."
He (will) say,|"Remain despised|in it|and (do) not|speak to Me."
Indeed,|(there) was|a party|of|My slaves|(who) said,|'Our Lord |We believe,|so forgive|us|and have mercy on us,|and You|(are) best|(of) those who show mercy."
But you took them|(in) mockery|until|they made you forget|My remembrance,|and you used (to)|at them|laugh.
Indeed, I|have rewarded them|this Day|because|they were patient,|indeed, they|[they]|(are) the successful ones.
He will say,|"How long|did you remain|in|the earth,|(in) number|(of) years?"
They will say,|"We remained|a day|or|a part|(of) a day;|but ask|those who keep count."
He will say,|"Not|you stayed|but|a little,|if|only you|[you]|knew.
Then did you think|that|We created you|uselessly|and that you|to Us|not|will be returned?"
So exalted is|Allah,|the King,|the Truth.|(There is) no|god|except|Him,|(the) Lord|(of) the Throne|Honorable.
And whoever|invokes|with|Allah|god|other,|no|proof|for him|in it.|Then only|his account|(is) with|his Lord.|Indeed, [he]|not|will succeed|the disbelievers.
And say,|"My Lord |Forgive|and have mercy,|and You|(are the) Best|(of) those who show mercy."
A Surah -|We (have) sent it down|and We (have) made it obligatory,|and We (have) sent down|therein|Verses|clear,|so that you may|take heed.
The fornicatress|and the fornicator,|[then] flog|each|one|of them|(with) hundred|lashe(s).|And (let) not|withhold you|pity for them||concerning|(the) religion of Allah,||if|you|believe|in Allah|and the Day|the Last.|And let witness|their punishment|a group|of|the believers.
The fornicator|(will) not|marry|except|a fornicatress,|or|a polytheist woman,|and the fornicatress -|(will) not|marry her|except|a fornicator|or|a polytheist man.|And is forbidden|that|to|the believers.
And those who|accuse|the chaste women,|then|not|they bring|four|witnesses,|then flog them|(with) eighty|lashe(s)|and (do) not|accept|their|testimony|ever.|And those,|they|(are) the defiantly disobedient,
Except|those who|repent|after||that|and reform.|Then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And those who|accuse|their spouses|and not|have|for them|witnesses|except|themselves,|then (the) testimony|(of) one of them|(is) four|testimonies|by Allah,|that he|(is) surely of|the truthful.
And the fifth|that|(the) curse of Allah||(be) upon him|if|he is|of|the liars.
But it would prevent|from her|the punishment|that|she bears witness|four|testimonies|by Allah|that he|(is) surely of|the liars.
And the fifth,|that|the wrath of Allah||(be) upon her|if|he is|of|the truthful.
And if not|(for) the Grace of Allah||upon you|and His Mercy -|and that,|Allah|(is) Oft-Returning (to Mercy),|All-Wise.
Indeed,|those who|brought|the lie|(are) a group|among you.|(Do) not|think it|bad|for you;|nay,|it|(is) good|for you.|For every|person|among them|(is) what|he earned|of|the sin,|and the one who|took upon himself a greater share of it||among them -|for him|(is) a punishment|great.
Why not,|when|you heard it,|think|the believing men|and the believing women|good of themselves||and say,|"This|(is) a lie|clear?"
Why (did) not|they bring|for it|four|witnesses?|Then when|not|they brought|the witnesses,|then those|near Allah,||they|(are) the liars.
And if not|(for the) Grace|(of) Allah|upon you|and His Mercy|in|the world|and the Hereafter,|surely would have touched you|in|what|you had rushed glibly|concerning it|a punishment|great.
When|you received it|with your tongues|and you said|with your mouths|what|not|for you||of it|any knowledge,|and you thought it|(was) insignificant,|while it|(was) near Allah|great.
And why not,|when|you heard it,|you said,|"Not|it is|for us|that|we speak|of this.|Glory be to You |This|(is) a slander|great"?
Allah warns you||that|you return|(to the) like of it|ever,|if|you are|believers.
And Allah makes clear||to you|the Verses.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
Indeed,|those who|like|that|(should) spread|the immorality|among|those who|believe,|for them|(is) a punishment|painful|in|the world|and the Hereafter.|And Allah|knows,|while you|(do) not|know.
And if not|(for the) Grace of Allah||upon you|and His Mercy.|And that|Allah|(is) Full of Kindness,|Most Merciful.
O you who believe |||(Do) not|follow|(the) footsteps|(of) the Shaitaan,|and whoever|follows|(the) footsteps|(of) the Shaitaan|then indeed, he|commands|the immorality|and the evil.|And if not|(for the) Grace of Allah||upon you|and His Mercy|not|(would) have been pure|among you|anyone||ever,|but|Allah|purifies|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Knower.
And not|let swear|those of virtue||among you|and the amplitude of means|that|they give|(to) the near of kin,||and the needy|and the emigrants|in|(the) way|(of) Allah.|And let them pardon|and let them overlook.|(Do) not|you like|that|Allah should forgive||you?|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|those who|accuse|the chaste women,|the unaware women|(and) the believing women,|are cursed|in|the world|and the Hereafter.|And for them|(is) a punishment|great.
(On a) Day,|will bear witness|against them|their tongues,|and their hands|and their feet|for what|they used|(to) do.
That Day,|Allah will pay them in full||their recompense,|the due,|and they will know|that|Allah,|He|(is) the Truth|the Manifest.
Evil women|(are) for evil men,|and evil men|(are) for evil women.|And good women|(are) for good men|and good men|(are) for good women.|Those|(are) innocent|of what|they say.|For them|(is) forgiveness|and a provision|noble.
O you|who|believe |(Do) not|enter|houses|other (than)|your houses|until|you have asked permission|and you have greeted|[on]|its inhabitants.|That|(is) best|for you|so that you may|pay heed.
But if|not|you find|in it|anyone,|then (do) not|enter it|until|permission has been given|to you.|And if|it is said|to you|"Go back,"|then go back;|it|(is) purer|for you.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Knower.
Not|upon you|(is) any blame|that|you enter|houses|not|inhabited,|in it|(is) a provision|for you.|And Allah|knows|what|you reveal|and what|you conceal.
Say|to the believing men|they should lower|their gaze||and they should guard|their chastity.|That|(is) purer|for them.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|they do.
And say|to the believing women|(that) they should lower|[of]|their gaze|and they should guard|their chastity,|and not|(to) display|their adornment|except|what|is apparent|of it.|And let them draw|their head covers|over|their bosoms,|and not|(to) display|their adornment|except|to their husbands,|or|their fathers|or|fathers|(of) their husbands|or|their sons|or|sons|(of) their husbands|or|their brothers|or|sons|(of) their brothers|or|sons|(of) their sisters,|or|their women|or|what|possess|their right hands|or|the attendants|having no physical desire|||among|[the] men|or|[the] children|who|(are) not|aware|of|private aspects|(of) the women.|And not|let them stamp|their feet|to make known|what|they conceal|of|their adornment.|And turn|to|Allah|altogether|O believers ||So that you may|succeed.
And marry|the single|among you|and the righteous|among|your male slaves,|and your female slaves.|If|they are|poor,|Allah will enrich them||from|His Bounty.|And Allah|(is) All-Encompassing,|All-Knowing.
And let be chaste|those who|(do) not|find|(means for) marriage|until|Allah enriches them||from|His Bounty.|And those who|seek|the writing|from (those) whom|possess|your right hands,|then give them (the) writing|if|you know|in them|any good|and give them|from|the wealth of Allah||which|He has given you.|And (do) not|compel|your slave girls|to|[the] prostitution,|if|they desire|chastity|that you may seek|temporary gain|(of) the life|(of) the world.|And whoever|compels them,|then indeed,|Allah|after||their compulsion|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And verily,|We have sent down|to you|Verses|clear,|and an example|of|those who|passed away|before you,||and an admonition|for those who fear (Allah).
Allah|(is the) Light|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|(The) example|(of) His Light|(is) like a niche|in it|(is) a lamp;|the lamp|(is) in|a glass,|the glass|as if it were|a star|brilliant|(which) is lit|from|a tree|blessed -|an olive,|not|(of the) east|and not|(of the) west,|would almost|its oil|glow,|even if|not|touched it|fire.|Light|upon|Light.|Allah guides||to His Light|whom|He wills.|And Allah sets forth||the examples|for the mankind.|And Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
In|houses|(which) Allah ordered||that|they be raised|and be mentioned|in them|His name.|Glorify|[to] Him|in them|in the mornings|and (in) the evenings.
Men -|not|distracts them|trade|and not|sale|from|(the) remembrance of Allah||and (from) establishing|the prayer|and giving|zakah.|They fear|a Day|will turn about|therein|the hearts|and the eyes.
That Allah may reward them||(with the) best|(of) what|they did,|and increase them|from|His Bounty.|And Allah|provides|whom|He wills|without|measure.
But those who|disbelieve,|their deeds|(are) like a mirage|in a lowland,|thinks it|the thirsty one|(to be) water,|until|when|he comes to it,|not|he finds it|(to be) anything,|but he finds|Allah|before him,|He will pay him in full|his due.|And Allah|(is) swift|(in) the account.
Or|(is) like (the) darkness[es]|in|a sea|deep,|covers it|a wave,|on it||a wave,|on it||a cloud,|darkness[es]|some of it|on|others.|When|he puts out|his hand|hardly||he (can) see it.|And (for) whom|not|Allah (has) made||for him|a light,|then not|for him|(is) any|light.
Do not|you see|that|Allah -|glorify|Him|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth|and the birds|(with) wings outspread?|Each one|verily|knows|its prayer|and its glorification.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower|of what|they do.
And to Allah (belongs)|(the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|And to|Allah|(is) the destination.
Do not|you see|that|Allah|drives|clouds|then|joins|between them|then|makes them|(into) a mass,|then you see|the rain|come forth|from|their midst?|And He sends down|from|(the) sky,|[from]|mountains|within it|[of]|(is) hail|and  He strikes|with it|whom|He wills|and averts it|from|whom|He wills.|Nearly|(the) flash|(of) its lighting|takes away|the sight.
Allah alternates||the night|and the day.|Indeed,|in|that|surely is a lesson|for those who have vision.|
And Allah|created|every|moving creature|from|water.|Of them|(is a kind) who|walks|on|its belly,|and of them|(is a kind) who|walks|on|two legs,|and of them|(is a kind) who|walks|on|four.|Allah creates||what|He wills.|Indeed,|Allah|on|every|thing|(is) All-Powerful.
Verily,|We have sent down|Verses|clear.|And Allah|guides|whom|He wills|to|a path|straight.
And they say,|"We believe|in Allah|and in the Messenger|and we obey."|Then|turns away|a party|of them|after||that.|And not|those|(are) believers.
And when|they are called|to|Allah|and His Messenger,|to judge|between them,|behold,|a party|of them|(is) averse.
But if|is|with them|the truth,|they come|to him|(as) promptly obedient.
Is (there) in|their hearts|a disease|or|do they doubt|or|they fear|that|Allah will be unjust||to them|and His Messenger?|Nay,|those|[they]|(are) the wrongdoers.
Only|is|(the) statement|(of) the believers|when|they are called|to|Allah|and His Messenger|to judge|between them|(is) that|they say,|"We hear|and we obey."|And those|[they]|(are) the successful.
And whoever|obeys|Allah|and His Messenger|and fears|Allah|and (is) conscious of Him,|then those|[they]|(are) the successful ones.
And they swear|by Allah|strong|their oaths|that if|you ordered them,|surely they (would) go forth.|Say,|"(Do) not|swear.|Obedience|(is) known.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do."
Say,|"Obey|Allah|and obey|the Messenger,|but if|you turn away|then only|upon him|(is) what|(is) placed on him,|and on you|(is) what|(is) placed on you.|And if|you obey him,|you will be guided.|And not|(is) on|the Messenger|except|the conveyance|[the] clear."
Allah (has) promised||those who|believe|among you|and do|righteous deeds,|surely He will grant them succession|in|the earth,|as|He gave succession|to those who|(were) before them,||and that He will surely establish|for them|their religion|which|He has approved|for them,|and surely He will change for them|after||their fear,|security|(for) they worship Me,|not|they associate|with Me|anything.|But whoever|disbelieved|after|that,|then those|[they]|(are) the defiantly disobedient.
And establish|the prayer|and give|zakah|and obey|the Messenger,|so that you may|receive mercy.
(Do) not|think|those who|disbelieve|(can) escape|in|the earth.|And their abode|(will be) the Fire|and wretched is|the destination.
O you who believe |||Let ask your permission|those whom|possess|your right hands|and those who|(have) not|reached|puberty|among you|(at) three|times,|before||(the) prayer|(of) dawn,|and when|you put aside|your garments|at|noon|and after||(the) prayer|(of) night.|(These) three|(are) times of privacy|for you.|Not|on you|and not|on them|any blame|after that|(as) moving about|among you,|some of you|among|others.|Thus|Allah makes clear||for you|the Verses,|and Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
And when|reach|the children|among you|the puberty|then let them ask permission|as|asked permission|those who|(were) before them.||Thus|Allah makes clear||for you|His Verses.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower|All-Wise.
And postmenopausal|among|the women|who|(do) not|have desire|(for) marriage,|then not is|on them|any blame|that|they put aside|their (outer) garments,|not|displaying|their adornment.|And that|they modestly refrain|(is) better|for them.|And Allah|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Knower.
Not is|on|the blind|any blame|and not|on|the lame|any blame|and not|on|the sick|any blame|and not|on|yourselves|that|you eat|from|your houses|or|houses|(of) your fathers|or|houses|(of) your mothers|or|houses|(of)  your brothers|or|houses|(of) your sisters|or|houses|(of) your paternal uncles|or|houses|(of) your paternal aunts|or|houses|(of) your maternal uncles|or|houses|(of) your maternal aunts|or|what|you possess|its keys|or|your friend.|Not is|on you|any blame|that|you eat|together|or|separately.|But when|you enter|houses|then greet|[on]|yourselves|a greeting|from||Allah|blessed|(and) good.|Thus|Allah makes clear||for you|the Verses|so that you may|understand.
Only|the believers|(are) those who|believe|in Allah|and His Messenger,|and when|they are|with him|for|a matter|(of) collective action,|not|they go|until|they (have) asked his permission.|Indeed,|those who|ask your permission,|those|[those who]|believe|in Allah|and His Messenger.|So when|they ask your permission|for some|affair of theirs,|then give permission|to whom|you will|among them,|and ask forgiveness|for them|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
(Do) not|make|(the) calling|(of) the Messenger|among you|as (the) call|(of) some of you|(to) others.|Verily,|Allah knows||those who|slip away|among you|under shelter.|So let beware|those who|oppose|[from]|his orders|lest|befalls them|a trial|or|befalls them|a punishment|painful.
No doubt |Indeed,|to Allah (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|Verily,|He knows|what|you|(are) on [it],|And (the) Day|they will be returned|to Him|then He will inform them|of what|they did.|And Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
Blessed is He|Who|sent down|the Criterion|upon|His slave|that he may be|to the worlds|a warner -
The One Who -|to Him (belongs)|(the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and not|He has taken|a son,|and not|He has|for Him|a partner|in|the dominion|and He (has) created|every|thing,|and determined it|(with) determination.
Yet they have taken|besides Him||gods|not|they create|anything,|while they|are created,|and not|they possess|for themselves|any harm|and not|any benefit,|and not|they control|death|and not|life|and not|resurrection.
And say|those who|disbelieve,|"Not|this|(is) but|a lie,|he invented it|and helped him|at it|people|other."|But verily,|they (have) produced|an injustice|and a lie.
And they say,|"Tales|(of) the former people|which he has had written|and they|are dictated|to him|morning|and evening."
Say,|"Has sent it down|the One Who|knows|the secret|in|the heavens|and the earth.|Indeed, He|is|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful."
And they say,|"Why does|this|Messenger|eat|[the] food|and walk|in|the markets?|Why not|is sent down|to him|an Angel|then he be|with him|a warner?
Or|is delivered|to him|a treasure|or|is|for him|a garden,|he may eat|from it?|And say|the wrongdoers,|"Not|you follow|but|a man|bewitched."
See|how|they set forth|for you|the similitudes,|but they have gone astray,|so not|they are able (to find)|a way.
Blessed is He|Who,|if|He willed|(could have) made|for you|better|than|that -|gardens -|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers|and He (could) make|for you|palaces.
Nay,|they deny|the Hour|and We have prepared|for (those) who|deny|the Hour,|a Blazing Fire.
When|it sees them|from|a place|far,|they will hear|its|raging|and roaring.
And when|they are thrown|thereof|(in) a place|narrow|bound in chains,|they will call|there|(for) destruction.
"(Do) not|call|this day|(for) destruction|one,|but call|(for) destructions|many."
Say,|"Is that|better|or|Garden|(of) Eternity,|which|is promised|(to) the righteous?|It will be|for them|a reward|and destination.
For them|therein|(is) whatever|they wish,|they will abide forever.|It is|on|your Lord|a promise|requested."
And (the) Day|He will gather them|and what|they worship|besides Allah|||and He will say,|"Did you|[you] mislead|My slaves|these|or|they|went astray|(from) the way?"
They say,|"Glory be to You |Not|it was proper||for us|that|we take|besides You||any|protectors.|But|You gave them comforts|and their forefathers|until|they forgot|the Message|and became|a people|ruined."
"So verily,|they deny you|in what|you say,|so not|you are able|(to) avert|and not|(to) help."|And whoever|does wrong|among you,|We will make him taste|a punishment|great.
And not|We sent|before you|any|Messengers|but|indeed, they|[surely] ate|food|and walked|in|the markets.|And We have made|some of you|for others|a trial,|will you have patience?|And is|your Lord|All-Seer.
And said|those who|(do) not|expect|(the) meeting with Us,|"Why not|are sent down|to us|the Angels|or|we see|our Lord?"|Indeed,|they have become arrogant|within|themselves|and (become) insolent|(with) insolence|great.
(The) Day|they see|the Angels,|no|glad tidings|(will be) that Day|for the criminals,|and they will say,|"A partition|forbidden."
And We will proceed|to|whatever|they did|of|(the) deed(s),|and We will make them|(as) dust|dispersed.
(The) companions|(of) Paradise,|that Day,|(will be in) a better|abode,|and a better|resting-place.
And (the) Day|will split open|the heavens|with the clouds|and (will be) sent down|the Angels,|descending.
The Sovereignty,|that Day|(will be) truly,|for the Most Gracious.|And (it will) be|a Day|for|the disbelievers|difficult.
And (the) Day|will bite|the wrongdoer|[on]|his hands,|he will say,|"O I wish |I had taken|with|the Messenger|a way.
O woe to me |I wish|not|I had taken|that one|(as) a friend.
Verily,|he led me astray|from|the Reminder|after|[when]|it (had) come to me.|And is|the Shaitaan|to the man|a deserter."
And said|the Messenger,|"O my Lord |Indeed,|my people|took|this|the Quran|(as) a forsaken thing."
And thus|We have made|for every|Prophet|an enemy,|among|the criminals.|But sufficient is|your Lord,|(as) a Guide|and a Helper.
And said|those who|disbelieve,|"Why not|was revealed|to him|the Quran|all at once?"||Thus,|that We may strengthen|thereby|your heart,|and We have recited it|(with distinct) recitation.
And not|they come to you|with an example|but|We bring you|the truth,|and (the) best|explanation.
Those who|will be gathered|on|their faces|to|Hell,|those|(are the) worst|(in) position|and most astray|(from the) way.
And verily,|We gave|Musa|the Scripture|and We appointed|with him|his brother|Harun|(as) an assistant.
Then We said,|"Go both of you|to|the people,|those who|have denied,|Our Signs."|Then We destroyed them|(with) destruction.
And (the) people|(of) Nuh,|when|they denied|the Messengers,|We drowned them|and We made them|for mankind|a sign.|And We have prepared|for the wrongdoers.|a punishment|painful.
And Ad|and Thamud|and (the) dwellers|(of) Ar-rass|and generations|between|that|many.
And each|We have set forth|for him|the examples,|and each|We destroyed|(with) destruction.
And verily,|they have come|upon|the town|which|was showered|(with) a rain|(of) evil.|Then do not|they [were]|see it?|Nay,|they are|not|expecting|Resurrection.
And when|they see you,|not|they take you|except|(in) mockery,|"Is this|the one whom|Allah has sent||(as) a Messenger?
He would have almost||[surely] misled us|from|our gods|if not|that|we had been steadfast|to them."|And soon|will know|when|they will see|the punishment,|who|(is) more astray|(from the) way.
Have you seen|(one) who|takes|(as) his god|his own desire?|Then would you|be|over him|a guardian?
Or|do you think|that|most of them|hear|or|understand?|Not|they|(are) except|like cattle.|Nay,|they|(are) more astray|(from the) way.
Do you not|see|[to]|your Lord|how|He extends|the shadow?|And if|He willed,|surely He (could) have made it|stationary.|Then|We made|the sun|for it|an indication.
Then|We withdraw it|to Us,|a withdrawal|gradual.
And He|(is) the One Who|made|for you|the night|(as) a covering|and the sleep|a rest|and made|the day|a resurrection.
And He|(is) the One Who|sends|the winds|(as) glad tidings|before||His Mercy,|and We send down|from|the sky|water|pure.
That We may give life|thereby|(to) a land|dead|and We give drink|thereof|(to those) We created,|cattle|and men|many.
And verily,|We have distributed it|among them|that they may remember,|but refuse|most|(of) the people|except|disbelief.
And if|We willed,|surely, We (would) have raised|in|every|town|a warner.
So (do) not|obey|the disbelievers|and strive (against) them|with it,|a striving|great.
And He|(is) the One Who|(has) released|the two seas|[this] (one)|palatable|and sweet|and [this] (one)|salty|(and) bitter,|and He has made|between them|a barrier|and a partition|forbidden.
And He|(is) the One Who|has created|from|the water|human being|and has made (for) him|blood relationship|and marriage relationship.|And is|your Lord|All-Powerful.
But they worship|besides Allah|||what|not profits them||and not|harms them,|and is|the disbeliever|against|his Lord|a helper.
And not|We sent you|except|(as) a bearer of glad tidings|and a warner.
Say,|"Not|I ask (of) you|for it|any|payment,|except|(that) whoever wills||to|take|to|his Lord|a way."
And put your trust|in|the Ever-living,|the One Who|does not die,||and glorify|with His Praise.|And sufficient is|He|regarding the sins|(of) His slaves,|All-Aware,
The One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them|in|six|periods,|then|He established Himself|over|the Throne -|the Most Gracious,|so ask|Him|(as He is) All-Aware.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Prostrate|to the Most Gracious."|They say,|"And what|(is) the Most Gracious?|Should we prostrate|to what|you order us?"|And it increases them|(in) aversion.
Blessed is He|Who|has placed|in|the skies|constellations|and has placed|therein|a lamp|and a moon|shining.
And He|(is) the One Who|made|the night|and the day|(in) succession|for whoever|desires|to|remember|or|desires|to be thankful.
And (the) slaves|(of) the Most Gracious|(are) those who|walk|on|the earth|(in) humbleness|and when|address them|the ignorant ones,|they say,|"Peace."
And those who|spend (the) night|before their Lord,|prostrating|and standing.
And those who|say,|"Our Lord |Avert|from us|the punishment|(of) Hell.|Indeed,|its punishment|is|inseparable,
Indeed, it|(is) an evil|abode|and resting place."
And those who,|when|they spend,|(are) not extravagant||and are not stingy||but are|between|that -|moderate.
And those who|(do) not|invoke|with|Allah|god|another,|and (do) not|[they] kill|the soul|which|Allah has forbidden||except|by right|and (do) not|commit adultery.|And whoever|does|that|will meet|a penalty.
Will be doubled|for him|the punishment|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection,|and he will abide forever|therein|humiliated
Except|(he) who|repents|and believes|and does|righteous deeds,||then (for) those|Allah will replace||their evil deeds|(with) good ones.|And is|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And whoever|repents|and does|righteous (deeds),|then indeed, he|turns|to|Allah|(with) repentance.
And those who|(do) not|bear witness|(to) the falsehood,|and when|they pass|by futility,|they pass|(as) dignified ones
And those who,|when|they are reminded|of (the) Verses|(of) their Lord,|(do) not|fall|upon them|deaf|and blind.
And those who|say,|"Our Lord |Grant|to us|from|our spouses|and our offspring|comfort|(to) our eyes,|and make us|for the righteous|a leader."
Those|will be awarded|the Chamber|because|they were patient|and they will be met|therein|(with) greetings|and peace.
Will abide forever|in it.|Good|(is) the settlement|and a resting place.
Say,|"Not|will care|for you|my Lord,|if not|your prayer (is to Him).|But verily,|you have denied,|so soon|will be|the inevitable (punishment)."
Ta Seen Meem.
These|(are the) Verses|(of) the Book|clear.
Perhaps you|(would) kill|yourself|that not|they become|believers.
If|We will,|We can send down|to them|from|the sky|a Sign|so would bend|their necks|to it|(in) humility.
And (does) not|come to them|any|reminder|from|the Most Gracious|new,|but|they|from it|turn away.
So verily,|they have denied,|then will come to them|the news|(of) what|they used|at it|(to) mock.
Do not|they see|at|the earth -|how many|We produced|in it|of|every|kind|noble.
Indeed,|in|that|surely (is) a sign,|but not|are|most of them|believers.
And indeed|your Lord,|surely, He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
And when|your Lord called||Musa,|[that],|"Go|(to) the people|(who are) wrongdoers
(The) people|(of) Firaun.|Will not|they fear?"
He said,|"My Lord |Indeed, I|[I] fear|that|they will deny me.
And straitens|my breast|and not|expresses well|my tongue,|so send|for|Harun.
And they have|against me|a crime,|so I fear|that|they will kill me."
He said,|"Nay,|go both of you|with Our Signs.|Indeed, We|(are) with you,|listening.
So go both of you|(to) Firaun|and say,|"Indeed, we|(are the) Messenger|(of the) Lord|(of) the worlds
[That]|send|with us|(the) Children of Israel.'"|
He said,|"Did not|we bring you up|among us|(as) a child,|and you remained|among us|of|your life|years?
And you did|your deed|which|you did,|and you|(were) of|the ungrateful."
He said,|"I did it|when|I|(was) of|those who are astray.
So I fled|from you|when|I feared you.|But granted|to me|my Lord,|judgment|and made me|of|the Messengers.
And this|(is the) favor|with which you reproach|[on] me,|that|you have enslaved|(the) Children of Israel."|
Firaun said||"And what|(is the)  Lord|(of) the worlds?"
He said,|"Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them,|if|you (should) be|convinced."
He said|to those|around him,|"Do not|you hear?"
He said,|"Your Lord|and (the) Lord|(of) your forefathers."|
He said,|"Indeed,|your Messenger|who|has been sent|to you|(is) surely mad."
He said,|"Lord|(of) the east|and the west|and whatever|(is) between them,|if|you were|(to) reason."
He said,|"If|you take|a god|other than me,|I will surely make you|among|those imprisoned."
He said,|"Even if|I bring you|something|manifest?"
He said,|"Then bring|it,|if|you are|of|the truthful."
So he threw|his staff|and behold |It|(was) a serpent,|manifest.
And he drew out|his hand|and behold |It|(was) white|for the observers.
He said|to the chiefs|around him,|"Indeed,|this|(is) surely a magician|learned.
He wants|to|drive you out|from|your land|by his magic,|so what|(do) you advise?"
They said,|"Postpone him|and his brother,|and send|in|the cities|gatherers -
They (will) bring to you|every|magician,|learned."
So were assembled|the magicians|for (the) appointment|(on) a day|well-known.
And it was said|to the people,|"Will|you|assemble
That we may|follow|the magicians|if|they are||the victorious?"
So when|came|the magicians,|they said|to Firaun,|"Is there|for us|a reward|if|we are||the victorious?"
He said,|"Yes,|and indeed you|then|surely (will be) of|the ones who are brought near."
Said|to them|Musa.|"Throw|what|you|(are) going to throw."
So they threw|their ropes|and their staffs|and said,|"By the might|(of) Firaun,|indeed, we|surely, we|(are) the victorious."
Then threw|Musa|his staff|and behold |It|swallowed|what|they falsified.
Then fell down|the magicians|prostrate.
They said,|"We believe|in (the) Lord|(of) the worlds,
Lord|(of) Musa|and Harun."
He said,|"You believed|in him|before|[that]|I gave permission|to you.|Indeed, he|(is) surely your chief|who|has taught you|the magic,|so surely soon|you will know.|I will surely cut off|your hands|and your feet|of|opposite sides,|and I will surely crucify you|all."
They said,|"No|harm.|Indeed, we|to|our Lord|(will) return.
Indeed, we|hope|that|will forgive|us|our Lord|our sins,|because|we are|(the) first|(of) the believers."
And We inspired|to|Musa,|[that]|"Travel by night|with My slaves,|indeed, you|(will be) followed."
Then sent|Firaun|in|the cities|gatherers,
"Indeed,|these|(are) certainly a band|small
And indeed, they|(are) surely enraging [to] us,|
And indeed, we|(are) surely a multitude|forewarned."
So We expelled them|from|gardens|and springs,
And treasures|and a place|honorable,
Thus.|And We caused to inherit them|(the) Children of Israel.|
So they followed them|(at) sunrise.
Then when|saw each other|the two hosts,|said|(the) companions|(of) Musa,|"Indeed, we|(are) surely to be overtaken."
He said,|"Nay,|indeed,|with me|(is) my Lord,|He will guide me."
Then We inspired|to|Musa,|[that]|"Strike|with your staff|the sea."|So it parted|and became|each|part|like the mountain|[the] great.
And We brought near|there,|the others.
And We saved|Musa|and who|(were) with him|all.
Then|We drowned|the others.
Indeed,|in|that|surely (is) a Sign,|but not|are|most of them|believers.
And indeed,|your Lord,|surely He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
And recite|to them|(the) news|(of) Ibrahim,
When|he said|to his father|and his people,|"What|(do) you worship?"
They said,|"We worship|idols,|so we will remain|to them|devoted."
He said,|"Do|they hear you|when|you call?
Or|(do) they benefit you|or|they harm (you)?"
They said,|"Nay,|but we found|our forefathers|like that -|doing."
He said,|"Do you see|what|you have been|worshipping,
You|and your forefathers.|
Indeed, they|(are) enemies|to me,|except|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds,
The One Who|created me,|and He|guides me.
And the One Who|[He]|gives me food|and gives me drink.
And when|I am ill,|then He|cures me,
And the One Who|will cause me to die|then|he will give me life,
And the One Who -|I hope|that|He will forgive|for me|my faults|(on the) Day|(of) the Judgment.
My Lord |Grant|[for] me|wisdom|and join me|with the righteous.
And grant|[for] me|a mention|(of) honor|among|the later (generations).
And make me|of|(the) inheritors|(of) Garden(s)|(of) Delight.
And forgive|my father.|Indeed, he|is|of|those astray.
And (do) not|disgrace me|(on the) Day|they are resurrected,
(The) Day|not|will benefit|wealth|and not|sons,
Except|(he) who|comes|(to) Allah|with a heart|sound."
And (will be) brought near|the Paradise|for the righteous.
And (will be) made manifest|the Hellfire|to the deviators.
And it will be said|to them,|"Where|(is) that|you used|(to) worship
Besides Allah?|||Can|they help you|or|help themselves?"
Then they will be overturned|into it,|they|and the deviators
And (the) hosts|(of) Iblis|all together.
They (will) say|while they|in it|(are) disputing,
"By Allah,|indeed,|we were|surely in|error|clear
When|we equated you|with (the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
And not|misguided us|except|the criminals.
So (now) not|we have|any|intercessors
And not|a friend|close.
Then if|that|we had|a return,|then we could be|of|the believers."
Indeed,|in|that|surely is a Sign,|but not|are|most of them|believers.
And indeed,|your Lord,|surely He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
Denied|(the) people|(of) Nuh|the Messengers
When|said|to them|their brother|Nuh,|"Will not|you fear (Allah)?
Indeed, I am|to you|a Messenger|trustworthy.
So fear|Allah|and obey me.
And not|I ask (of) you|for it|any|payment.|Not|(is) my payment|but|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
So fear|Allah|and obey me."
They said,|"Should we believe|in you|while followed you|the lowest?"
He said,|"And what|(do) I know|of what|they used|(to) do?
Verily,|their account|(is) but|upon|my Lord,|if|you perceive.
And not|I am|the one to drive away|the believers.
Not|I am|but|a warner|clear."
They said,|"If|not|you desist,|O Nuh |Surely you will be|of|those who are stoned."
He said,|"My Lord |Indeed,|my people|have denied me.
So judge|between me|and between them|(with decisive) judgment,|and save me|and who|(are) with me|of|the believers."
So We saved him|and who|(were) with him|in|the ship,|laden.
Then|We drowned|thereafter|the remaining ones.
Indeed,|in|that|surely, (is) a sign|but not|are|most of them|believers.
And indeed,|your Lord|surely, He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
Denied|(the people) of Aad|the Messengers.
When|said|to them|their brother|Hud,|"Will not|you fear (Allah)?
Indeed, I am|to you|a Messenger|trustworthy.
So fear|Allah|and obey me.
And not|I ask you|for it|any|payment.|Not|(is) my payment|except|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Do you construct|on every|elevation|a sign,|amusing yourselves,
And take for yourselves|strongholds|that you may|live forever?
And when|you seize,|you seize|(as) tyrants.
So fear|Allah|and obey me.
And fear|the One Who|has aided you|with what|you know,
He has aided you|with cattle|and children,
And gardens|and springs.
Indeed, I|[I] fear|for you|(the) punishment|(of) a Day|Great."
They said,|"(It is) same|to us|whether you advise|or|not|you are|of|the advisors.
Not|(is) this|but|(the) custom|(of) the former (people),
And not|we|(are) the ones to be punished."
So they denied him,|then  We destroyed  them.|Indeed,|in|that|surely, is a sign,|but not|are|most of them|believers.
And indeed,|your Lord|surely, He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
Denied|Thamud,|the Messengers
When,|said|to them|their brother|Salih,|"Will not|you fear (Allah)?
Indeed, I am|to you|a Messenger|trustworthy.
So fear|Allah|and obey me.
And not|I ask you|for it|any|payment.|Not|(is) my payment|except|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Will you be left|in|what|(is) here|secure,
In|gardens|and springs,
And cornfields|and date-palms|its spadix|soft?
And you carve|of|the mountains,|houses|skillfully.
So fear|Allah|and obey me.
And (do) not|obey|(the) command|(of) the transgressors,
Those who|spread corruption|in|the earth|and (do) not|reform."
They said,|"Only|you|(are) of|those bewitched.
Not|you|(are) except|a man|like us,|so bring|a sign,|if|you|(are) of|the truthful."
He said,|"This|(is) a she-camel.|For her|(is a share of)  drink,|and for you|(is a share of) drink|(on) a day|known.
And (do) not|touch her|with harm,|lest seize you|(the) punishment|(of) a Day|Great."
But they hamstrung her,|then they became|regretful.
So seized them|the punishment.|Indeed,|in|that|surely is a sign,|but not|are|most of them|believers.
And indeed,|your Lord,|surely He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
Denied,|(the) people|(of) Lut,|the Messengers.
When|said|to them|their brother|Lut,|"Will not|you fear (Allah)?
Indeed, I am|to you|a Messenger|trustworthy.
So fear|Allah|and obey me.
And not|I ask you|for it|any|payment|Not|(is) my payment|except|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Do you approach|the males|among|the worlds
And you leave|what|created|for you|your Lord,|of|your mates?|Nay,|you|(are) a people|transgressing."
They said,|"If|not|you desist,|O Lut |Surely, you will be|of|the ones driven out."
He said,|"Indeed, I am|(of) your deed|of|those who detest.
My Lord |Save me|and my family|from what|they do."
So We saved him|and his family|all,
Except|an old woman,|(was) among|those who remained behind.
Then|We destroyed|the others.
And We rained|upon them|a rain,|and evil was|(was) the rain|(on) those who were warned.
Indeed,|in|that|surely is a sign,|but not|are|most of them|believers.
And indeed,|your Lord,|surely, He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
Denied|(the) companions|(of the) Wood,|the Messengers.
When,|said|to them|Shuaib,|"Will not|you fear (Allah)?
Indeed, I am|to you|a Messenger|trustworthy.
So fear|Allah|and obey me.
And not|I ask (of) you|for it|any|payment.|Not|(is) my payment|except|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Give full|measure|and (do) not|be|of|those who cause loss.
And weigh|with a balance,|[the] even.
And (do) not|deprive|people|(of) their things,|and (do) not|commit evil|in|the earth,|spreading corruption.
And fear|the One Who|created you|and the generations|the former."
They said,|"Only|you|(are) of|those bewitched.
And not|you|(are) except|a man|like us,|and indeed,|we think you|surely (are) of|the liars.
Then cause to fall|upon us|fragments|of|the sky,|if|you are|of|the truthful."
He said,|"My Lord|knows best|of what|you do."
But they denied him,|so seized them|(the) punishment|(of the) day|(of) the shadow.|Indeed, it|was|(the) punishment|(of) a Day|Great.
Indeed,|in|that|surely, is a sign|but not|are|most of them|believers.
And indeed,|your Lord|surely, He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
And indeed, it|surely, is a Revelation|(of the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Has brought it down,||the Spirit|[the] Trustworthy,
Upon|your heart,|that you may be|of|the warners
In language|Arabic|clear.
And indeed, it|surely, (is) in|(the) Scriptures|(of) the former (people).
Is it not||to them|a sign|that|know it|(the) scholars|(of the) Children|(of) Israel?
And if|We (had) revealed it|to|any|(of) the non-Arabs
And he (had) recited it|to them,|not|they would|in it|(be) believers.
Thus|We have inserted it|into|(the) hearts|(of) the criminals.
Not|they will believe|in it|until|they see|the punishment|[the] painful.
And it will come to them|suddenly,|while they|(do) not|perceive.
Then they will say,|"Are|we|(to be) reprieved?"
So is it for Our punishment|they wish to hasten?
Then have you seen|if|We let them enjoy|(for) years
Then|comes to them|what|they were|promised
Not|(will) avail|them|what|enjoyment they were given.|
And not|We destroyed|any|town|but|it had|warners
(To) remind,|and not|We are|unjust.
And not|have brought it down||the devils.
And not|(it) suits|[for] them|and not|they are able.
Indeed, they|from|the hearing|(are) surely banished.
So (do) not|invoke|with|Allah,|god|another|lest you be|of|those punished.
And warn|your kindred|[the] closest.
And lower|your wing|to (those) who|follow you|of|the believers.
Then if|they disobey you|then say,|"Indeed, I am|innocent|of what|you do."
And put (your) trust|in|the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful,
The One Who|sees you|when|you stand up
And your movements|among|those who prostrate.
Indeed, He|[He]|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Knower.
Shall|I inform you|upon|whom|descend|the devils?
They descend|upon|every|liar|sinful.
They pass on|(what is) heard,|and most of them|(are) liars.
And the poets -|follow them|the deviators.
Do not|you see|that they|in|every|valley|[they] roam,
And that they|say|what|not|they do?
Except|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|and remember|Allah|much,|and defend themselves|after|||they were wronged.|And will come to know|those who|have wronged|(to) what|return|they will return.
Ta Sin.|These|(are the) Verses|(of) the Quran|and a Book|clear
A guidance|and glad tidings|for the believers,
Those who|establish|the prayer|and give|zakah|and they|in the Hereafter|[they]|believe with certainty.
Indeed,|those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter,|We have made fair-seeming|to them|their deeds,|so they|wander blindly.
Those|(are) the ones,|for them|(is) an evil|[the] punishment|and they|in|the Hereafter|[they]|(will be) the greatest losers.
And indeed, you|surely, receive|the Quran|from [near]||the All-Wise,|the All-Knower.
When|said|Musa|to his family,|"Indeed, I|perceive|a fire.|I will bring you|from it|some information|or|I will bring you|a torch|burning|so that you may|warm yourselves."
But when|he came to it,|he was called|[that]|"Blessed is|who|(is) at|the fire|and whoever|(is) around it.|And glory be|(to) Allah|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
O Musa |Indeed,|I Am|Allah,|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise."
And, "Throw|your staff."|But when|he saw it|moving|as if it|(were) a snake|he turned back|(in) flight|and (did) not|look back.|"O Musa |(Do) not|fear.|Indeed, [I]|(do) not|fear|(in) My presence|the Messengers.
Except|who|wrongs|then|substitutes|good|after|evil,|then indeed, I Am|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And enter|your hand|into|your bosom|it will come forth|white|without||harm.|(These are) among|nine|signs|to|Firaun|and his people.|Indeed, they|are|a people|defiantly disobedient."
But when|came to them|Our Signs|visible,|they said,|"This|(is) a magic|manifest."
And they rejected|them,|though were convinced with them (signs)|themselves,|(out of) injustice|and haughtiness.|So see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the corrupters.
And verily,|We gave|Dawood|and Sulaiman|knowledge,|and they said,|"Praise be|to Allah|the One Who|has favored us|over|many|of|His servants|the believers."
And inherited|Sulaiman|Dawood.|And he said,|"O|people |We have been taught|(the) language|(of) the birds,|and we have been given|from|every|thing.|Indeed,|this|surely, it|(is) the favor|evident."
And were gathered|for Sulaiman|his hosts|of|jinn|and the men|and the birds,|and they|(were) set in rows.
Until,|when|they came|to|(the) valley|(of) the ants,|said|an ant,|"O|ants |Enter|your dwellings|lest not crush you||Sulaiman|and his hosts|while they|(do) not perceive."|
So he smiled -|laughing|at|her speech|and said,|"My Lord |Grant me (the) power|that|I may thank You|(for) Your Favor|which|You have bestowed|on me|and on|my parents|and that|I may do|righteous (deeds),|that will please You.|And admit me|by Your Mercy|among|Your slaves|righteous."
And he inspected|the birds|and said,|"Why||not|I see|the hoopoe|or|is he|from|the absent?
I will surely punish him|(with) a punishment|severe|or|I will surely slaughter him|unless|he brings me|a reason|clear."
So he stayed|not|long,|and he said,|"I have encompassed|that which|not|you have encompassed|it,|and I have come to you|from|Saba|with news|certain.
Indeed, I|found|a woman|ruling them|and she has been given|of|every|thing|and for her|(is) a throne|great.
And I found her|and her people|prostrating|to the sun|instead of Allah,|||and has made fair-seeming|to them|the Shaitaan|their deeds,|and averted them|from|the Way,|so they|(are) not|guided,
That not|they prostrate|to Allah,|the One Who|brings forth|the hidden|in|the heavens|and the earth|and knows|what|you conceal|and what|you declare,
Allah|(there is) no|god|but|He,|(the) Lord|(of) the Throne|the Great."
He said,|"We will see|whether you speak (the) truth|or|you are|of|the liars.
Go|with my letter,|this,|and deliver it|to them.|Then|turn away|from them|and see|what|they return."
She said,|"O|chiefs |Indeed [I],|is delivered|to me|a letter|noble.
Indeed, it|(is) from|Sulaiman|and indeed it (is),|'In the name|(of) Allah,|the Most Gracious,|the Most Merciful,
That not|exalt yourselves|against me,|but come to me|(in) submission.'"
She said,|"O|chiefs |Advise me|in|my affair.|Not|I would be|the one to decide|any matter|until|you are present with me."
They said,|"We|(are) possessors|(of) strength|and possessors|(of) might|great,|and the command|(is) up to you,|so look|what|you will command."
She said,|"Indeed,|the kings,|when|they enter|a town|they ruin it|and make|(the) most honorable|(of) its people|(the) lowest.|And thus|they do.
But indeed, I am|going to send|to them|a gift|and see|with what|return|the messengers."
So when|came|(to) Sulaiman|he said,|"Will you provide me|with wealth?|But what|Allah has given me||(is) better|than what|He has given you.|Nay,|you|in your gift|rejoice.
Return|to them,|surely, we will come to them|with hosts|not|(is) resistance|for them|of it,|and surely, we will drive them out|from there|(in) humiliation,|and they|(will be) abased."
He said,|"O|chiefs |Which of you|will bring me|her throne|before|that|they come to me|(in) submission?"
Said|a strong one|of|the jinn,|"I|will bring it to you||before|[that]|you rise|from|your place.|And  indeed, I am|for it|surely, strong,|trustworthy."
Said|one who,|with him|(was) knowledge|of|the Scripture,|"I|will bring it to you||before|[that]|returns|to you|your glance."|Then when|he saw it|placed|before him,|he said,|"This|(is) from|(the) Favor|(of) my Lord,|to test me|whether I am grateful|or|I am ungrateful.|And whoever|(is) grateful|then only|he is grateful|for his own soul.|And whoever|(is) ungrateful,|then indeed,|my Lord|(is) Self-sufficient,|Noble.
He said,|"Disguise|for her|her throne;|we will see|whether she will be guided|or|will be|of|those who|are not guided."|
So when|she came,|it was said,|"Is like this|your throne?"|She said,|"It is like|it."|"And we were given|the knowledge|before her||and we have been|Muslims."
And has averted her|what|she used (to)|worship|besides||Allah.|Indeed, she|was|from|a people|who disbelieve.
It was said|to her,|"Enter|the palace."|Then when|she saw it,|she thought it|(was) a pool,|and she uncovered|[on]|her shins.|He said,|"Indeed, it|(is) a palace|made smooth|of|glass."|She said,|"My Lord,|indeed, I|[I] have wronged|myself,|and I submit|with|Sulaiman|to Allah,|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds."
And certainly,|We sent|to|Thamud|their brother|Salih|that,|"Worship|Allah."|Then behold |They|(became) two parties|quarreling.
He said,|"O my people |Why|(do) you seek to hasten|the evil|before|the good?|Why not|you ask forgiveness|(of) Allah|so that you may|receive mercy?"
They said,|"We consider you a bad omen||and those|with you."|He said,|"Your bad omen|(is) with|Allah.|Nay,|you|(are) a people|being tested."
And were|in|the city|nine|family heads,|they were spreading corruption|in|the land|and not|reforming.
They said,|"Swear to each other|by Allah|surely, we will attack him by night,|and his family.|Then|we will surely say|to his heir,|"Not|we witnessed|(the) destruction|(of) his family,|and indeed, we|(are) surely truthful.'"
So they plotted|a plot|and We planned|a plan,|while they|(did) not|perceive.
Then see|how|was|(the) end|(of) their plot,|that We|destroyed them|and their people|all.
So, these|(are) their houses,|ruined|because|they wronged.|Indeed,|in|that|surely, is a sign|for a people|who know.
And We saved|those who|believed|and used (to)|fear (Allah).
And Lut,|when|he said|to his people,|"Do you commit|[the] immorality|while you|see?
Why do you|approach|the men|(with) lust|instead of||the women?|Nay,|you|(are) a people|ignorant."
But not|was|(the) answer|(of) his people|except|that|they said,|"Drive out|(the) family|(of) Lut|from|your town.|Indeed, they|(are) people|who keep clean and pure."
So We saved him|and his family,|except|his wife;|We destined her|(to be) of|those who remained behind.
And We rained|upon them|a rain,|and was evil|(the) rain|(on) those who were warned.
Say,|"All praise (be)|to Allah,|and peace (be)|upon|His slaves|those whom|He has chosen.|Is Allah|better|or what|they associate (with Him)?"
Or Who|has created|the heavens|and the earth|and sent down|for you|from|the sky|water?|And  We caused to grow|thereby|gardens|of beauty (and delight),||not|it is|for you|that|you cause to grow|their trees.|Is there any god|with|Allah?|Nay,|they|(are) a people|who ascribe equals.
Or Who|made|the earth|a firm abode|and made|(in) its midst|rivers|and made|for it|firm mountains|and made|between|the two seas|a barrier?|Is there any god|with|Allah?|Nay,|most of them|(do) not|know.
Or Who|responds|(to) the distressed one|when|he calls Him|and He removes|the evil|and makes you|inheritors|(of) the earth?|Is there any god|with|Allah?|Little|(is) what|you remember.
Or Who,|guides you|in|(the) darkness[es]|(of) the land|and the sea|and Who|sends|the winds|(as) glad tidings|before||His Mercy?|Is there any god|with|Allah?|High is|Allah|above what|they associate (with Him).
Or Who|originates|the creation|then|repeats it|and Who|provides you|from|the heavens|and the earth?|Is there any god|with|Allah?|Say,|"Bring forth|your proof|if|you are|truthful."
Say,|"No (one)|knows|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth|(of) the unseen|except|Allah,|and not|they perceive|when|they will be resurrected."
Nay,|is arrested|their knowledge|of|the Hereafter?|Nay|they|(are) in|doubt|about it.|Nay,|they|about it|(are) blind.
And say|those who|disbelieve,|"What, when|we have become|dust|and our forefathers,|will we|surely be brought out?
Certainly,|we have been promised|this,|we|and our forefathers|before.||Not|(is) this|except|tales|(of) the former (people)."
Say,|"Travel|in|the land,|and see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the criminals."
And (do) not|grieve|over them|and not|be|in|distress|from what|they plot.
And they say,|"When|(will) this|promise (be fulfilled),|if|you are|truthful."
Say,|"Perhaps|that|is|close behind|you,|some|(of) that which|you seek to hasten."
And indeed,|your Lord|(is) full of Bounty||for|the mankind,|but|most of them|(are) not|grateful.
And indeed,|your Lord|surely knows|what|conceals|their breasts|and what|they declare.
And not (is)|any (thing)|hidden|in|the heavens|and the earth|but|(is) in|a Record|clear.
Indeed,|this|[the] Quran|relates|to|(the) Children|(of) Israel,|most|(of) that|they|in it|differ.
And indeed, it|(is) surely a guidance|and a mercy|for the believers.
Indeed,|your Lord|will judge|between them|by His Judgment,|and He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Knower.
So put your trust|in|Allah,|indeed, you|(are) on|the truth|manifest.
Indeed, you|(can)not|cause to hear|the dead|and not|can you cause to hear|the deaf|the call|when|they turn back|retreating.
And not|(can) you|guide|the blind|from|their error.|Not|you can cause to hear|except|(those) who|believe|in Our Signs|so they|(are) Muslims.
And when|(is) fulfilled|the word|against them,|We will bring forth|for them|a creature|from|the earth|speaking to them,|that|the people|were,|of Our Signs,|not|certain.
And (the) Day|We will gather|from|every|nation|a troop|of (those) who|deny|Our Signs,|and they|will be set in rows.
Until,|when|they come,|He will say,|"Did you deny|My Signs|while not|you encompassed|them|(in) knowledge,|or what|you used (to)|do?"
And (will be) fulfilled|the word|against them|because|they wronged,|and they|(will) not|speak.
Do not|they see|that We|[We] have made|the night|that they may rest|in it,|and the day|giving visibility?|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who believe.
And (the) Day|will be blown|[in]|the trumpet|and will be terrified|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and whoever|(is) in|the earth|except|whom|Allah wills.||And all|(will) come to Him|humbled.
And you see|the mountains,|thinking them|firmly fixed,|while they|will pass|(as the) passing|(of) the clouds.|(The) Work|(of) Allah|Who|perfected|all|things.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do.
Whoever|comes|with the good,|then for him|(will be) better|than it,|and they,|from|(the) terror|(of) that Day|(will be) safe.
And whoever|comes|with the evil,|will be cast down|their faces|in|the Fire.|"Are|you recompensed|except|(for) what|you used (to)|do?"
"Only|I am commanded|that|I worship|(the) Lord|(of) this|city,|the One Who|made it sacred|and to Him (belongs)|all|things.|And I am commanded|that|I be|of|the Muslims
And that|I recite|the Quran."|And whoever|accepts guidance|then only|he accepts guidance|for himself;|and whoever|goes astray|then say,|"Only|I am|of|the warners."
And say,|"All praise (be)|to Allah,|He will show you|His Signs,|and you will recognize them.|And your Lord is not||unaware|of what|you do."
Ta Sin Mim.
These|(are the) Verses|(of) the Book|the clear.
We recite|to you|from|(the) news|(of) Musa|and Firaun|in truth|for a people|who believe.
Indeed,|Firaun|exalted himself|in|the land|and made|its people|(into) sects,|oppressing|a group|among them,|slaughtering|their sons|and letting live|their women.|Indeed, he|was|of|the corrupters.
And [We] wanted|to|bestow a favor|upon|those who|were oppressed|in|the land|and make them|leaders|and make them|the inheritors,
And we establish|them|in|the land|and show|Firaun|and Haman|and their hosts|through them|what|they were|fearing.
And We inspired|[to]|(the) mother|(of) Musa|that,|"Suckle him,|but when|you fear|for him,|then cast him|in(to)|the river|and (do) not|fear|and (do) not|grieve.|Indeed, We|(will) restore him|to you|and (will) make him|of|the Messengers."
Then picked him up|(the) family|(of) Firaun|so that he might become|to them|an enemy|and a grief.|Indeed,|Firaun|and Haman|and their hosts|were|sinners.
And said|(the) wife|(of) Firaun,|"A comfort|(of the) eye|for me|and for you;|(Do) not|kill him;|perhaps|(that)|he may benefit us,|or|we may take him|(as) a son."|And they|(did) not|perceive.
And became|(the) heart|(of the) mother|(of) Musa|empty.|That,|she was near|(to) disclosing|about him,|if not|that|We strengthened|[over]|her heart,|so that she would be|of|the believers.
And she said|to his sister,|"Follow him."|So she watched|him|from|a distance|while they|(did) not|perceive.
And We had forbidden|for him|the wet nurses|before,||so she said,|"Shall I|direct you|to|(the) people|(of) a house|who will rear him|for you|while they|to him|(will be) sincere?"
So We restored him|to|his mother|that|might be comforted|her eye,|and not|she may grieve|and that she would know,|that|the Promise of Allah||(is) true.|But|most of them|(do) not|know.
And when|he reached|his full strength|and became mature,|We bestowed upon him|wisdom|and knowledge.|And thus|We reward|the good-doers.
And he entered|the city|at|a time|(of) inattention|of|its people|and found|therein|two men|fighting each other;|this|of|his party|and this|of|his enemy.|And called him for help|the one who|(was) from|his party|against|the one who|(was) from|his enemy,|so Musa struck him with his fist||and killed him.||He said,|"This (is)|of|(the) deed|(of) Shaitaan.|Indeed, he|(is) an enemy -|one who misleads|clearly."
He said,|"My Lord |Indeed, I|[I] have wronged|my soul,|so forgive|[for] me."|Then He forgave|[for] him.|Indeed He,|He (is)|the Oft-Forgiving,|the Most Merciful.
He said,|"My Lord |Because|You have favored|[on] me,|so not|I will be|a supporter|(of) the criminals."
In the morning he was|in|the city|fearful|(and) was vigilant,|when behold |The one who|sought his help|the previous day|cried out to him for help.|Said|to him|Musa,|"Indeed, you|(are) surely a deviator|clear."
Then when|[that]|he wanted|to|strike|the one who|[he] (was)|an enemy|to both of them,|he said,|"O Musa |Do you intend|to|kill me|as|you killed|a person|yesterday?|Not|you want|but|that|you become|a tyrant|in|the earth,|and not|you want|that|you be|of|the reformers."
And came|a man|from|(the) farthest end|(of) the city|running.|He said,|"O Musa |Indeed,|the chiefs|are taking counsel|about you|to kill you,|so leave;|indeed, I am|to you|of|the sincere advisors."
So he left|from it|fearing,|(and) vigilant.|He said,|"My Lord |Save me|from|the people -|the wrongdoers."
And when|he turned his face|towards|Madyan,|he said,|"Perhaps|my Lord|[that]|will guide me|(to the) sound|way."
And when|he came|(to the) water|(of) Madyan,|he found|on it|a group|of|men|watering,|and he found|besides them||two women|keeping back.|He said,|"What|(is the) matter with both of you?"|They said,|"We cannot water||until||take away|the shepherds;|and our father|(is) a very old man."
So he watered|for them.|Then|he turned back|to|the shade|and said,|"My Lord |Indeed, I am|of whatever|You send|to me|of|good|(in) need."
Then came to him|one of the two women|walking|with|shyness.|She said,|"Indeed,|my father|calls you,|that he may reward you|(the) reward|(for) what|you watered|for us."|So when|he came to him|and narrated|to him|the story,|he said,|"(Do) not|fear.|You have escaped|from|the people -|the wrongdoers."
Said|one of them,|"O my father |Hire him.|Indeed,|(the) best|whom|you (can) hire|(is) the strong,|the trustworthy."
He said,|"Indeed, I|[I] wish|to|marry you to|one|(of) my daughters|(of) these two|on|that|you serve me,|(for) eight|years;|but if|you complete|ten,|then from|you.|And not|I wish|to|make it difficult|for you.|You will find me,|if|Allah wills,||of|the righteous."
He said,|"That|(is) between me|and between you.|Whichever|(of) the two terms|I complete|then no|injustice|to me,|and Allah,|over|what|we say|(is) a Witness."
Then when|Musa fulfilled||the term|and was traveling|with his family,|he saw|in|(the) direction|(of) Mount Tur|a fire.|He said|to his family,|"Stay here;|indeed, I|[I] perceive|a fire.|Perhaps|I will bring you|from there|some information|or|a burning wood|from|the fire|so that you may|warm yourselves."
But when|he came (to) it,|he was called|from|(the) side|(of) the valley -|the right|in|the place even,|blessed,|from|the tree|that,|"O Musa |Indeed,|I Am|Allah,|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
And [that]|throw|your staff."|But when|he saw it|moving|as if it|(were) a snake|he turned|(in) flight|and (did) not|return.|"O Musa |Draw near|and (do) not|fear.|Indeed, you|(are) of|the secure.
Insert|your hand|in|your  bosom|it will come forth|white|without||any harm.|And draw|to yourselves|your hand|against|fear.|So these|(are) two evidences|from|your Lord,|to|Firaun|and his chiefs.|Indeed, they|are|a people|defiantly disobedient."
He said,|"My Lord |Indeed,|I killed|of them|a man,|and I fear|that|they will kill me.
And my brother|Harun,|he|(is) more eloquent|than me|(in) speech,|so send him|with me|(as) a helper,|who will confirm me.|Indeed,|I fear|that|they will deny me."
He said,|"We will strengthen|your arm|through your brother|and We will make|for both of you|an authority,|so not|they will reach|to both of you.|Through Our Signs|you two|and (those) who|follow you,|(will) be the dominant."
But when|came to them|Musa|with Our Signs|clear,|they said,|"Not|(is) this|except|a magic|invented,|and not|we heard|of this|among|our forefathers."|
And Musa said,||"My Lord|knows best|of who|has come|with [the] guidance|from Him||and who -|will be|for him|the good end in the Hereafter.||Indeed,|not|will be successful|the wrongdoers."
And Firaun said,||"O chiefs ||Not|I know|for you|any|god|other than me.|So kindle|for me|O Haman |Upon|the clay|and make,|for me|a lofty tower|so that [I]|I may look|at|(the) God|(of) Musa.|And indeed, I|[I] think that he|(is) of|the liars."
And he was arrogant,||and his hosts|in|the land|without|right,|and they thought|that they|to Us|not|will be returned.
So We seized him|and his hosts,|and We threw them|in|the sea.|So see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the wrongdoers.
And We made them|leaders|inviting|to|the Fire,|and (on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|not|they will be helped.
And We caused to follow them|in|this|world|a curse,|and (on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|they|(will be) of|the despised.
And verily,|We gave|Musa|the Scripture,|after [what]|||We had destroyed|the generations|former|(as) an enlightenment|for the mankind|and a guidance|and mercy|that they may|remember.
And not|you were|on (the) side|western|when|We decreed|to|Musa|the Commandment|and not|you were|among|the witnesses.
But We|[We] produced|generations|and prolonged|for them|the life.|And not|you were|a dweller|among|(the) people|(of) Madyan,|reciting|to them|Our Verses,|but We|[We] were|the Senders.
And not|you were|at (the) side|(of) the Tur|when|We called.|But|(as) a mercy|from|your Lord|so that you warn|a people|not|(had) come to them|any|warner|before you||so that they may|remember.
And if not|[that]|struck them|a disaster|for what|had sent forth|their hands|and they would say,|"Our Lord |Why not|You sent|to us|a Messenger|so we (could have) followed|Your Verses|and we (would) have been|of|the believers?"
But when|came to them|the truth|from Us||they said,|"Why not|he was given|(the) like|(of) what|was given|(to) Musa?"|Did not|they disbelieve|in what|was given|(to) Musa|before?||They said,|"Two magic (works)|supporting each other."|And they said,|"Indeed, we|in all|(are) disbelievers."
Say,|"Then bring|a Book|from Allah,|||which|(is) a better guide|than both of them|that I may follow it,|if|you are|truthful."
But if|not|they respond|to you,|then know|that only|they follow|their desires.|And who|(is) more astray|than (one) who|follows|his own desire|without|guidance|from|Allah?|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|the people -|the wrongdoers.
And indeed,|We have conveyed|to them|the Word|so that they may|remember.
Those who,|We gave them|the Scripture|before it,||they|in it|believe.
And when|it is recited|to them|they say,|"We believe|in it.|Indeed, it|(is) the truth|from|our Lord.|Indeed, we|[we] were|before it||Muslims."
Those|will be given|their reward|twice|because|they are patient|and they repel|with good -|the evil|and from what|We have provided them|they spend.
And when|they hear|vain talk,|they turn away|from it|and say,|"For us|our deeds|and for you|your deeds.|Peace (be)|on you;|not|we seek|the ignorant."
Indeed, you|(can) not|guide|whom|you love,|but|Allah|guides|whom|He wills.|And He|(is) most knowing|(of) the guided ones.
And they say,|"If|we follow|the guidance|with you,|we would be swept|from|our land."|Have not|We established|for them|a sanctuary|secure,|are brought|to it|fruits|(of) all|things,|a provision|from|Us?|But|most of them|(do) not|know.
And how many|We have destroyed|of|a town|which exulted,|(in) its means of livelihood.|And these|(are) their dwellings|not|have been inhabited|after them||except|a little.|And indeed, [We]|We|(are) the inheritors.
And not|was|your Lord|(the) one to destroy|the towns|until|He (had) sent|in|their mother (town)|a Messenger|reciting|to them|Our Verses.|And not|We would be|(the) one to destroy|the towns|except|while their people|(were) wrongdoers.
And whatever|you have been given|from|things,|(is) an enjoyment|(of the) life|(of) the world|and its adornment.|And what|(is) with|Allah,|(is) better|and more lasting.|So (will) not|you use intellect?
Then is (he) whom|We have promised him|a promise|good,|and he|(will) meet it,|like (the one) whom|We provided him|enjoyment|(of the) life|(of) the world|then|he|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|(will be) among|those presented?
And (the) Day|He will call them|and say,|"Where,|(are) My partners|whom|you used (to)|claim?"
(Will) say|those -|(has) come true|against whom|the Word,|"Our Lord |These|(are) those whom|we led astray.|We led them astray|as|we were astray.|We declare our innocence|before You.|Not|they used (to)|worship us."|
And it will be said,|"Call|your partners."|And they will call them,|but not|they will respond|to them|and they will see|the punishment.|If only|[that] they|had been|guided 
And (the) Day|He will call them|and say,|"What|did you answer|the Messengers?"
But (will) be obscure|to them|the information|that day,|so they|will not ask one another.|
But as for|(him) who|repented|and believed,|and did|righteousness,|then perhaps|[that]|he will be|of|the successful ones.
And your Lord|creates|what|He wills|and chooses.|Not|they have|for them|the choice.|Glory be|(to) Allah|and High is He|above what|they associate (with Him).
And your Lord|knows|what|conceals|their breasts|and what|they declare.
And He|(is) Allah;|(there is) no|god|but|He.|To Him|(are due) all praises|in|the first|and the last.|And for Him|(is) the Decision,|and to Him|you will be returned.
Say,|"Have you seen|if|Allah made||for you|the night|continuous|till|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|who|(is the) god|besides|Allah|who could bring you|light?|Then will not|you hear?"
Say,|"Have you seen|if|Allah made||for you|the day|continuous|till|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|who|(is the) god|besides|Allah|who could bring you|night|(for) you (to) rest|in it?|Then will not|you see?"
And from|His Mercy|He made|for you|the night|and the day,|that you may rest|therein|and that you may seek|from|His Bounty,|and so that you may|be grateful.
And (the) Day|He will call them|and say,|"Where|(are) My partners|whom|you used (to)|claim?"
And We will draw forth|from|every|nation|a witness|and We will say,|"Bring|your proof?"|Then they will know|that|the truth|(is) for Allah|and (will be) lost|from them|what|they used (to)|invent.
Indeed,|Qarun,|was|from|(the) people|(of) Musa,|but he oppressed|[on] them.|And We gave him|of|the treasures|which|indeed|(the) keys of it|would burden|a company (of men)|possessors of great strength.||When|said|to him|his people,|"(Do) not|exult.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|the exultant.
But seek,|through what|Allah has given you,||the home|(of) the Hereafter,|and (do) not|forget|your share|of|the world.|And do good|as|Allah has been good||to you.|And (do) not|seek|corruption|in|the earth.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|love|the corrupters."
He said,|"Only|I have been given it|on (account)|(of) knowledge|I have."|Did not|he know|that|Allah|indeed|destroyed|before him||of|the generations|who|[they]|(were) stronger|than him|(in) strength|and greater|(in) accumulation.|And not|will be questioned|about|their sins|the criminals.
So he went forth|to|his people|in|his adornment.|Said|those who|desire|the life|(of) the world,|"O  Would that|for us|(the) like|(of) what|has been given|(to) Qarun.|Indeed, he|(is the) owner|(of) fortune|great."
But said|those who|were given|the knowledge,|"Woe to you |(The) reward|(of) Allah|(is) better|for (he) who|believes|and does|righteous (deeds).|And not|it is granted|except|(to) the patient ones."
Then We caused to swallow up,|him|and his home,|the earth.|Then not|was|for him|any|group|(to) help him|besides||Allah,|and not|was|(he) of|those who (could) defend themselves.
And began,|those who|(had) wished|his position|the day before|(to) say,|"Ah  That|Allah|extends|the provision|for whom|He wills|of|His slaves,|and restricts it.|If not|that|Allah had favored||[to] us|He would have caused it to swallow us.||Ah  That|not|will succeed|the disbelievers."
That|the Home|(of) the Hereafter|We assign it|to those who|(do) not|desire|exaltedness|in|the earth|and not|corruption.|And the good end|(is) for the righteous.
Whoever|comes|with a good (deed)|then for him,|(will be) better|than it;|and whoever|comes|with an evil (deed)|then not|will be recompensed|those who|do|the evil (deeds)|except|what|they used (to)|do.
Indeed,|He Who|ordained|upon you|the Quran|(will) surely take you back|to|a place of return.|Say,|"My Lord|(is) most knowing|(of him) who|comes|with the guidance,|and who -|he|(is) in|an error|manifest."
And not|you were|expecting|that|would be sent down|to you|the Book,|except|(as) a mercy|from|your Lord.|So (do) not|be|an assistant|to the disbelievers.
And (let) not|avert you|from|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|after|[when]|they have been revealed|to you.|And invite (people)|to|your Lord.|And (do) not|be|of|the polytheists.
And (do) not|invoke|with|Allah|god|other.|(There is) no|god|except|Him.|Every|thing|(will be) destroyed|except|His Face.|To Him|(is) the Decision,|and to Him|you will be returned.
Alif Laam Mim.
Do think|the people|that|they will be left|because|they say,|"We believe"|and they|will not be tested?|
And indeed,|We tested|those who|(were) before them.||And Allah will surely make evident||those who|(are) truthful|and He will surely make evident|the liars.
Or|think|those who|do|evil deeds|that|they can outrun Us.|Evil is|what|they judge.
Whoever|[is]|hopes|(for the) meeting|(with) Allah,|then indeed,|(the) term|(of) Allah|(is) surely coming.|And He|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Knower.
And whoever|strives|then only|he strives|for himself.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Free from need|of|the worlds.
And those who|believe|and do|righteous (deeds),|surely, We will remove|from them|their evil deeds,|and We will surely reward them|(the) best|(of) what|they used|(to) do.
And We have enjoined|(on) man|goodness to his parents,||but if|they both strive against you|to make you associate|with Me|what|not|you have|of it|any knowledge,|then (do) not|obey both of them.|To Me|(is) your return,|and I will inform you|about what|you used|(to) do.
And those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|We will surely admit them|among|the righteous.
And of|the people|(is he) who|says,|"We believe|in Allah."|But when|he is harmed|in|(the Way of) Allah|he considers|(the) trial|(of) the people|as (the) punishment|(of) Allah.|But if|comes|victory|from|your Lord,|surely they say,|"Indeed, we|were|with you."|Is not|Allah|most knowing|of what|(is) in|(the) breasts|(of) the worlds?
And Allah will surely make evident||those who|believe,|And He will surely make evident|the hypocrites.
And said,|those who|disbelieve|to those who|believe,|"Follow|our way,|and we will carry|your sins."|But not|they|(are) going to carry|of|their sins|any|thing.|Indeed, they|(are) surely liars.
But surely they will carry|their burdens|and burdens|with|their burdens,|and surely they will be questioned|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|about what|they used|(to) invent.
And verily,|We sent|Nuh|to|his people,|and he remained|among them|a thousand|year(s),|save|fifty|year(s),|then seized them|the flood,|while they|(were) wrongdoers.
But We saved him|and (the) people|(of) the ship,|and We made it|a Sign|for the worlds.
And Ibrahim -|when|he said|to his people,|"Worship|Allah|and fear Him.|That|(is) better|for you|if|you|know.
Only|you worship|besides||Allah|idols,|and you create|falsehood.|Indeed,|those whom|you worship|besides||Allah|(do) not|possess|for you|any provision.|So seek|from|Allah|the provision|and worship Him|and be grateful|to Him.|To Him|you will be returned.
And if|you deny|then verily,|denied|(the) nations|before you.||And not|(is) on|the Messenger|except|the conveyance|clear."
Do not|they see|how|Allah originates||the creation|then|repeats it.|Indeed,|that|for|Allah|(is) easy.
Say,|"Travel|in|the earth|and see|how|He originated|the creation|Then|Allah|will produce|the creation|the last.|Indeed,|Allah|on|every|thing|(is) All-Powerful."
He punishes|whom|He wills|and has mercy|(on) whom|He wills,|and to Him|you will be returned.
And not|you|can escape|in|the earth|and not|in|the heaven.|And not|for you|besides||Allah|any|protector|and not|a helper.
And those who|disbelieve|in (the) Signs|(of) Allah|and (the) meeting (with) Him,|those|(have) despaired|of|My Mercy.|And those,|for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
And not|was|(the) answer|(of) his people|except|that|they said,|"Kill him|or|burn him."|But Allah saved him||from|the fire.|Indeed,|in|that,|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who believe.
And he said,|"Only|you have taken|besides||Allah|idols|(out of) love|among you|in|the life|(of) the world.|Then|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|you will deny|one another||and curse|one another,||and your abode|(will be) the Fire|and not|for you|any|helpers.
And believed|[in] him|Lut,|and he said,|"Indeed I (am)|emigrating|to|my Lord.|Indeed, He|[He] (is)|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise."
And We granted|to him|Ishaq|and Yaqub|and We placed|in|his offsprings|the Prophethood|and the Book.|And We gave him|his reward|in|the world.|And indeed, he|in|the Hereafter|(is) surely, among|the righteous.
And Lut,|when|he said|to his people,|"Indeed, you|commit|the immorality,|not|has preceded you|with it|any|one|from|the worlds.
Indeed, you|approach|the men,|and you cut off|the road|and commit|in|your meetings|evil?"|And not|was|(the) answer|(of) his people|except|that|they said,|"Bring upon us|(the) punishment|(of) Allah|if|you are|of|the truthful."
He said,|"My Lord |Help me|against|the people|the corrupters."
And when|came|Our Messengers|(to) Ibrahim|with the glad tidings|they said,|"Indeed, we|(are) going to destroy|(the) people|(of) this|town.|Indeed,|its people|are|wrongdoers."
He said,|"Indeed,|in it|(is) Lut."|They said,|"We|know better|who|(is) in it.|We will surely save him|and his family,|except|his wife.|She|(is) of|those who remain behind."
And when|[that]|came|Our Messengers|(to) Lut|he was distressed|for them,|and felt straitened|for them|(and) uneasy.|And they said,|"(Do) not|fear|and (do) not|grieve.|Indeed, we|(will) save you|and your family,|except|your wife.|She|(is) of|those who remain behind.
Indeed, we|(will) bring down|on|(the) people|(of) this|town|a punishment|from|(the) sky,|because|they have been|defiantly disobedient."
And verily,|We have left|about it|a sign,|(as) evidence|for a people|who use reason.
And to|Madyan|their brother|Shuaib.|And he said,|"O my people |Worship|Allah|and expect|the Day|the Last,|and (do) not|commit evil|in|the earth|(as) corrupters."
But they denied him,|so seized them|the earthquake,|and they became|in|their home|fallen prone.
And Aad|and Thamud,|and verily,|(has) become clear|to you|from|their dwellings.|And made fair-seeming|to them|the Shaitaan|their deeds|and averted them|from|the Way,|though they were|endowed with insight.
And Qarun,|and Firaun|and Haman.|And certainly|came to them|Musa|with clear evidences,|but they were arrogant|in|the earth,|and not|they could|outstrip Us.
So each|We seized|for his sin.|Then of them|(was he) who,|We sent|on him|a violent storm,|and of them|(was he) who,|seized him|the awful cry|and of them|(was he) who,|We caused to swallow|him,|the earth|and of them|(was he) who,|We drowned.|And not|was|Allah|to wrong them|but|they were|themselves|doing wrong.
(The) example|(of) those who|take|besides||Allah|protectors|(is) like|the spider|who takes|a house.|And indeed,|the weakest|(of) houses|(is) surely (the) house|(of) the spider,|if (only)|they|know.
Indeed,|Allah|knows|what|they invoke|besides Him||any|thing.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
And these|examples|We set forth|to mankind,|but not|will understand them|except|those of knowledge.
Allah created||the heavens|and the earth|in truth.|Indeed,|in|that|(is) surely a Sign|for the believers.
Recite|what|has been revealed|to you|of|the Book,|and establish|the prayer.|Indeed,|the prayer|prevents|from|the immorality|and evil deeds,|and surely (the) remembrance|(of) Allah|(is) greatest.|And Allah|knows|what|you do.
And (do) not|argue|(with the) People of the Book||except|by which|[it]|(is) best,|except|those who|(do) wrong|among them,|and say,|"We believe|in that (which)|has been revealed|to us|and was revealed|to you.|And our God|and your God|(is) One,|and we|to Him|submit."
And thus|We (have) revealed|to you|the Book.|So those|We gave [them]|the Book|believe|therein.|And among|these|(are some) who|believe|therein.|And none|reject|Our Verses|except|the disbelievers.
And not|(did) you|recite|before it,||any|Book,|and not|(did) you write it|with your right hand,|in that case|surely (would) have doubted|the falsifiers.
Nay,|it|(is) Verses|clear|in|(the) breasts|(of) those who|are given|the knowledge.|And not|reject|Our Verses|except|the wrongdoers.
And they say,|"Why not|are sent down|to him|(the) Signs|from|his Lord?"|Say,|"Only|the Signs|(are) with|Allah,|and only|I (am)|a warner|clear."
And is (it) not|sufficient for them|that We|revealed|to you|the Book|(which) is recited|to them?|Indeed,|in|that,|surely is a mercy|and a reminder|for a people|who believe.
Say,|"Sufficient is|Allah|between me|and between you|(as) a Witness.|He knows|what|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|And those who|believe|in [the] falsehood|and disbelieve|in Allah,|those,|they|(are) the losers."
And they ask you to hasten|[with] the punishment.|And if not|(for) a term|appointed,|surely (would) have come to them|the punishment.|But it will surely come to them|suddenly|while they|(do) not|perceive.
They ask you to hasten|the punishment.|And indeed,|Hell,|will surely, encompass|the disbelievers
On (the) Day|will cover them|the punishment|from|above them|and from|below|their feet,|and He will say,|"Taste|what|you used|(to) do."
O My servants|who|believe |Indeed,|My earth|(is) spacious,|so only|worship Me.
Every|soul|(will) taste|the death.|Then|to Us|you will be returned.
And those who|believe|and do|[the] righteous deeds,|surely We will give them a place|in|Paradise|lofty dwellings,|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers,|will abide forever|in it.|Excellent is|(the) reward|(of) the workers
Those who|(are) patient|and upon|their Lord|put their trust.
And how many|of|a creature|(does) not|carry|its provision.|Allah|provides (for) it|and (for) you.|And He|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Knower.
And if|you ask them,|"Who|created|the heavens|and the earth,|and subjected|the sun|and the moon?"|Surely they would say|"Allah."|Then how|are they deluded?
Allah|extends|the provision|for whom|He wills|of|His slaves|and restricts|for him.|Indeed,|Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
And if|you ask  them,|"Who|sends down|from|the sky|water|and gives life|thereby|(to) the earth|after||its death?"|Surely, they would say,|"Allah."|Say,|"All Praises|(are) for Allah."|But|most of them|(do) not|use reason.
And not|(is) this|life|(of) the world|but|amusement|and play.|And indeed,|the Home|(of) the Hereafter -|surely, it|(is) the life,|if only|they|know.
And when|they embark|[in]|the ship,|they call|Allah|(being) sincere|to Him|(in) the religion.|But when|He delivers them|to|the land,|behold,|they|associate partners (with Him)
So that they may deny|[in] what|We have given them,|and they may enjoy (themselves).|But soon|they will know.
Do not|they see|that We|have made|a Sanctuary|secure|while are being taken away|the people|around them?||Then do in the falsehood|they believe|and in (the) Favor|(of) Allah|they disbelieve?
And who|(is) more unjust|than (he) who|invents|against|Allah|a lie|or|denies|the truth|when|it has come to him.|Is there not|in|Hell|an abode|for the disbelievers?
And those who|strive|for Us,|We will surely, guide them|(to) Our ways.|And indeed,|Allah|surely (is) with|the good-doers.
Alif Lam Meem.
Have been defeated|the Romans
In|(the) nearest|land.|But they,|after||their defeat,|will overcome
Within|a few|years.|For Allah|(is) the command|before||and after.||And that day|will rejoice|the believers
With (the) help|(of) Allah.|He helps|whom|He wills.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
(It is the) Promise|(of) Allah.|(Does) not|fail|Allah|(in) His promise,|but|most (of)|[the] people|(do) not|know.
They know|(the) apparent|of|the life|(of) the world,|but they,|about|the Hereafter,|[they]|(are) heedless.
Do not|they ponder|within|themselves?|Not|Allah (has) created||the heavens|and the earth,|and what|(is) between them|except|in truth|and (for) a term|appointed.|And indeed,|many|of|the people|in (the) meeting|(with) their Lord|surely (are) disbelievers.
Have not|they traveled|in|the earth|and observed|how|was|(the) end|(of) those|before them?||They were|mightier|than them|(in) strength,|and they dug|the earth|and built (on) it|more|than what|they have built (on) it.|And came (to) them|their Messengers|with clear proofs.|So not|was|Allah|to wrong them|but|they were|themselves|(doing) wrong.
Then|was|(the) end|(of) those who|did evil -|the evil,|because|they denied|(the) Signs|(of) Allah|and were|of them|making mockery.
Allah|originates|the creation,|then|He repeats it,|then|to Him|you will be returned.
And (the) Day|will (be) established|the Hour,|will (be in) despair|the criminals.
And not|will be|for them|among|theirs partners|any intercessors|and they will be|in their partners|disbelievers.
And (the) Day|will (be) established|the Hour,|that Day|they will become separated.
Then as for|those who|believed|and did|righteous deeds,|so they|in|a Garden|will be delighted.
But as for|those who|disbelieved|and denied|Our Signs|and (the) meeting|(of) the Hereafter,|then those|in|the punishment|(will be) brought forth.
So glory be to|Allah|when|you reach the evening|and when|you reach the morning.
And for Him|(are) all praises|in|the heavens|and the earth|and (at) night|and when|you are at noon.
He brings forth|the living|from|the dead|and He brings forth|the dead|from|the living,|and He gives life|(to) the earth|after|its death,|and thus|you will be brought forth.
And among|His Signs|(is) that|He created you|from|dust|then|behold |You|(are) human beings|dispersing.
And among|His Signs|(is) that|He created|for you|from|yourselves|mates|that you may find tranquility|in them;|and He placed|between you|love|and mercy.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who reflect.
And among|His Signs|(is the) creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and the diversity|(of) your languages|and your colors.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for those of knowledge.
And among|His Signs|(is) your sleep|by night|and the day|[and] your seeking|of|His Bounty.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who listen.
And among|His Signs|He shows you|the lightning|(causing) fear|and hope,|and He sends down|from|the sky|water|and gives life|therewith|(to) the earth|after|its death.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who use intellect.
And among|His Signs|(is) that|stands|the heavens|and the earth|by His Command.|Then|when|He calls you|(with) a call,|from|the earth,|behold |You|will come forth.
And to Him (belongs)|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|All|to Him|(are) obedient.
And He|(is) the One Who|originates|the creation|then|repeats it,|and it|(is) easier|for Him.|And for Him|(is) the description,|the highest|in|the heavens|and the earth.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
He sets forth|to you|an example|from|yourselves.|Is|for you|among|what|possess|your right hands|any|partners|in|what|We have provided you|so you|in it|(are) equal,|you fear them|as you fear|yourselves?|Thus|We explain|the Verses|for a people|(who) use reason.
Nay,|follow|those who|do wrong,|their desires,|without|knowledge.|Then who|(can) guide|(one) whom|Allah has let go astray?||And not|for them|any|helpers.
So set|your face|to the religion|upright.|Nature|(made by) Allah|(upon) which|He has created|mankind|[on it].|No|change|(should there be) in the creation|(of) Allah.|That|(is) the religion|the correct,|but|most|men|(do) not|know.
Turning|to Him,|and fear Him|and establish|the prayer|and (do) not|be|of|the polytheists
Of|those who|divide|their religion|and become|sects,|each|party|in what|they have|rejoicing.
And when|touches|people|hardship,|they call|their Lord|turning|to Him.|Then|when|He causes them to taste|from Him|Mercy|behold |A party|of them|with their Lord|associate partners
So as to deny|[in] what,|We have granted them.|Then enjoy,|but soon|you will know.
Or|have We sent|to them|an authority|and it|speaks|of what|they were|with Him|associating?
And when|We cause people to taste||mercy,|they rejoice|therein.|But if|afflicts them|an evil|for what|have sent forth|their hands,|behold |They|despair.
Do not|they see|that|Allah|extends|the provision|for whom|He wills|and straitens (it).|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for a people|who believe.
So give|the relative||his right|and the poor|and the wayfarer.||That|(is) best|for those who|desire|(the) Countenance|(of) Allah.|And those,|they|(are) the successful ones.
And what|you give|for|usury|to increase|in|(the) wealth|(of) people,|not|(will) increase|with|Allah.|But what|you give|of|zakah|desiring|(the) Countenance|(of) Allah,|then those|[they]|(will) get manifold.
Allah|(is) the One Who|created you,|then|He provided (for) you,|then|He will cause you to die|then|He will give you life.|Is (there)|any|(of) your partners|who|does|of|that|any|thing?|Glory be to Him|and exalted is He|above what|they associate.
Has appeared|the corruption|in|the land|and the sea|for what|have earned|(the) hands|(of) people,|so that He may let them taste|a part|(of) that which|they have done|so that they may|return.
Say,|"Travel|in|the earth|and see|how|was|(the) end|(of) those who|(were) before.||Most of them were||polytheists."
So set|your face|to the religion|right,|before||[that]|comes|a Day|not|(can be) averted|[it]|from|Allah.|That Day,|they will be divided.
Whoever|disbelieves,|then against him|(is) his disbelief.|And whoever|does|righteousness,|then for themselves|they are preparing,
That He may reward|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|(out) of|His Bounty.|Indeed, He|(does) not|like|the disbelievers.
And among|His Signs|(is) that|He sends|the winds|(as) bearers of glad tidings|and to let you taste|of|His Mercy,|and that may sail|the ships|at His Command,|and that you may seek|of|His Bounty,|and that you may|be grateful.
And verily,|We sent|before you||Messengers|to|their people,|and they came to them|with clear proofs;|then We took retribution|from|those who|committed crimes.|And it was|incumbent|upon Us|(to) help|the believers.
Allah|(is) the One Who|sends|the winds,|so they raise|(the) clouds,|then He spreads them|in|the sky,|how|He wills,|and He makes them|fragments|so you see|the rain|coming forth|from|their midst.|Then when|He causes it to fall on||whom|He wills|of|His slaves,|behold |They|rejoice.
And certainly|they were,|before||[that]|it was sent down|upon them,|[before it],||surely in despair.
So look|at|(the) effects|(of the) Mercy|(of) Allah,|how|He gives life|(to) the earth|after|its death.|Indeed,|that|surely He (will) give life|(to) the dead.|And He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
But if|We sent|a wind|and they see it|turn yellow,|certainly they continue|after it||(in) disbelief.
So indeed, you|(can) not|make the dead hear||and not|make the deaf hear||the call|when|they turn,|retreating.
And not|you|can guide|the blind|from|their error.|Not|you can make hear|except|(those) who|believe|in Our Verses|so they|surrender.
Allah|(is) the One Who|created you|from|weakness,|then|made|after||weakness|strength,|then|made|after||strength|weakness|and gray hair.|He creates|what|He wills,|and He|(is) the All-Knower|the All-Powerful.
And (the) Day|will (be) established|the Hour|will swear|the criminals|not|they remained|but|an hour.|Thus|they were|deluded.
But will say|those who|were given|the knowledge|and the faith,|"Verily,|you remained|by|(the) Decree|(of) Allah|until|(the) Day|(of) Resurrection.|And this|(is the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|but you|were|not|knowing.
So that Day,|not|will profit|those who|wronged|their excuses|and not|they|will be allowed to make amends.
And verily,|We (have) set forth|for mankind|in|this -|[the] Quran|of|every|example.|But if|you bring them|a sign,|surely will say|those who|disbelieve,|"Not|you|(are) except|falsifiers."
Thus|Allah seals||[on]|(the) hearts|(of) those who|(do) not|know.
So be patient.|Indeed,|(the) Promise|(of) Allah|(is) true.|And (let) not|take you in light estimation|those who|(are) not|certain in faith.
Alif Lam Meem.
These|(are) Verses|(of) the Book|the Wise,
A guidance|and a mercy|for the good-doers,
Those who|establish|the prayer|and give|zakah|and they,|in the Hereafter,|[they]|believe firmly.
Those|(are) on|guidance|from|their Lord,|and those|[they]|(are) the successful.
And of|the mankind|(is he) who|purchases,|idle tales||to mislead|from|(the) path|(of) Allah|without|knowledge,|and takes it|(in) ridicule.|Those|for them|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
And when|are recited|to him|Our Verses,|he turns away|arrogantly|as if|not|he (had) heard them,|as if|in|his ears|(is) deafness.|So give him tidings|of a punishment|painful.
Indeed,|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds,|for them|(are) Gardens|(of) Delight,
(To) abide forever|in it.|(The) Promise of Allah||(is) true.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
He created|the heavens|without|pillars|that you see|and has cast|in|the earth|firm mountains|lest|it (might) shake|with you,|and He dispersed|in it|from|every|creature.|And We sent down|from|the sky|water|then We caused to grow|therein|of|every|kind|noble.
This|(is the) creation|(of) Allah.|So show Me|what|have created|those|besides Him.||Nay,|the wrongdoers|(are) in|error|clear.
And verily,|We gave|Luqman|the wisdom|that,|"Be grateful|to Allah."|And whoever|(is) grateful|then only|he is grateful|for himself.|And whoever|(is) ungrateful,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Free of need,|Praiseworthy.
And when|said|Luqman|to his son|while he|(was) instructing him,|"O my son |(Do) not|associate partners|with Allah.|Indeed,|associating partners|(is) surely an injustice|great."
And We have enjoined|(upon) man|for his parents -|carried him|his mother|(in) weakness|upon|weakness,|and his weaning|(is) in|two years|that|"Be grateful|to Me|and to your parents;|towards Me|(is) the destination.
But if|they strive against you|on|that|you associate partners|with Me|what|not|you have|of it|any knowledge,|then (do) not|obey both of them.|But accompany them|in|the world|(with) kindness,|and follow|(the) path|(of him) who|turns|to Me.|Then|towards Me|(is) your return,|then I will inform you|of what|you used (to)|do."
"O my son |Indeed it,|if|it be|(the) weight|(of) a grain|of|a mustard seed,|and it be|in|a rock|or|in|the heavens|or|in|the earth|Allah will bring it forth.|||Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Subtle,|All-Aware.
O my son |Establish|the prayer|and enjoin|[with] the right|and forbid|from|the wrong,|and be patient|over|what|befalls you.|Indeed,|that|(is) of|the matters requiring determination.|
And  (do) not|turn|your cheek|from men|and (do) not|walk|in|the earth|exultantly.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|like|every|self-conceited|boaster.
And be moderate|in|your pace|and lower|[of]|your voice.|Indeed,|(the) harshest|(of all) sounds|(is) surely (the) voice|(of) the donkeys."
Do not|you see|that|Allah|has subjected|to you|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth|and amply bestowed|upon you|His Bounties|apparent|and hidden?|But of|the people|(is he) who|disputes|about|Allah|without|knowledge,|and not|guidance|and not|a book|enlightening.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Follow|what|Allah (has) revealed,"||they say,|"Nay,|we will follow|what|we found|on it|our forefathers."|Even if|Shaitaan was||(to) call them|to|(the) punishment|(of) the Blaze 
And whoever|submits|his face|to|Allah|while he|(is) a good-doer,|then indeed,|he has grasped|the handhold|the most trustworthy.|And to|Allah|(is the) end|(of) the matters.
And whoever|disbelieves,|let not|grieve you|his disbelief.|To Us|(is) their return,|then We will inform them|of what|they did.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) the All-Knower|of what|(is in) the breasts.
We grant them enjoyment|(for) a little,|then|We will force them|to|a punishment|severe.
And if|you ask them,|"Who|created|the heavens|and the earth?"|They will surely say,|"Allah."|Say,|"All praises|(are) for Allah."|But|most of them|(do) not|know.
To Allah (belongs)|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|Indeed,|Allah,|He|(is) Free of need,|the Praiseworthy.
And if|whatever|(is) in|the earth|of|(the) trees|(were) pens|and the sea,|(to) add to it|after it||seven|seas,|not|would be exhausted|(the) Words|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Not|(is) your creation|and not|your resurrection|but|as a soul|single.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Seer.
Do not|you see|that|Allah|causes to enter|the night|into|the day,|and causes to enter|the day|into|the night|and has subjected|the sun|and the moon,|each|moving|for|a term|appointed,|and that|Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Aware.
That|(is) because|Allah,|He|(is) the Truth,|and that|what|they call|besides Him||(is) [the] falsehood,|and that|Allah,|He|(is) the Most High,|the Most Great.
Do not|you see|that|the ships|sail|through|the sea|by (the) Grace|(of) Allah|that He may show you|of|His Signs?|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for everyone|(who is) patient,|grateful.
And when|covers them|a wave|like canopies,|they call|Allah,|(being) sincere|to Him|(in) religion.|But when|He delivers them|to|the land|then among them|(some are) moderate.|And not|deny|Our Signs|except|every|traitor|ungrateful.
O|mankind |Fear|your Lord|and fear|a Day|not|can avail|a father|[for]|his son|and not|a son,|he|(can) avail|[for]|his father|anything.|Indeed,|(the) Promise|(of) Allah|(is) True,|so let not deceive you||the life|(of) the world|and let not deceive you||about Allah|the deceiver.
Indeed,|Allah,|with Him|(is the) knowledge|(of) the Hour|and He sends down|the rain,|and knows|what|(is) in|the wombs.|And not|knows|any soul|what|it will earn|tomorrow,|and not|knows|any soul|in what|land|it will die.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knower|All-Aware.
Alif Lam Meem.
(The) revelation|(of) the Book,|(there is) no|doubt|about it,|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Or|(do) they say,|"He invented it"?|Nay,|it|(is) the truth|from|your Lord|that you may warn|a people|not|has come to them|any|warner|before you||so that they may|be guided.
Allah|(is) the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them|in|six|periods.|Then|established Himself|on|the Throne.|Not|for you|besides Him||any|protector|and not|any intercessor.|Then will not|you take heed?
He regulates|the affair|of|the heaven|to|the earth;|then|it will ascend|to Him|in|a  Day,|(the) measure of which is||a thousand|years|of what|you count.
That|(is the) Knower|(of) the hidden|and the witnessed,|the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful,
The One Who|made good|every|thing|He created,|and He began|(the) creation|(of) man|from|clay.
Then|He made|his progeny|from|an extract|of|water|despised.
Then|He fashioned him|and breathed|into him|from|His spirit|and made|for you|the hearing|and the sight|and feelings;|little|[what]|thanks you give.
And they say,|"Is (it) when|we are lost|in|the earth,|will we|certainly be in|a creation|new?"|Nay,|they|in (the) meeting|(of) their Lord|(are) disbelievers.
Say,|"Will take your soul|(the) Angel|(of) the death|the one who|has been put in charge|of you.|Then|to|your Lord|you will be returned."
And if|you (could) see|when|the criminals|(will) hang|their heads|before|their Lord,|"Our Lord|we have seen|and we have heard,|so return us,|we will do|righteous (deeds).|Indeed, we|(are now) certain."
And if|We (had) willed,|surely We (would) have given|every|soul|its guidance,|but|(is) true|the Word|from Me|that, "I will surely fill|Hell|with|the jinn|and the men|together.
So taste|because|you forgot|(the) meeting,|(of) this Day of yours.||Indeed, We|have forgotten you.|And taste|(the) punishment|(of) eternity|for what|you used (to)|do."
Only|believe|in Our Verses|those who|when|they are reminded|of them|fall down|prostrating|and glorify|(the) praises|(of) their Lord,|and they|are not arrogant.|
Forsake|their sides|from|(their) beds;|they call|their Lord|(in) fear|and hope,|and out of what|We have provided them|they spend.
And not|knows|a soul|what|is hidden|for them|of|(the) comfort|(for) the eyes|(as) a reward|for what|they used (to)|do.
Then is one who|is|a believer|like (him) who|is|defiantly disobedient?|Not|they are equal.
As for|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds,|then for them|(are) Gardens|(of) Refuge|(as) hospitality|for what|they used (to)|do.
But as for|those who|are defiantly disobedient|then their refuge|(is) the Fire.|Every time|they wish|to|come out|from it,|they (will) be returned|in it,|and it (will) be said|to them,|"Taste|(the) punishment|(of) the Fire|which|you used (to)|[in it]|deny."
And surely, We will let them taste|of|the punishment|the nearer|before|the punishment|the greater,|so that they may|return.
And who|(is) more unjust|than (he) who|is reminded|of (the) Verses|(of) his Lord,|then|he turns away|from them?|Indeed, We|from|the criminals,|(will) take retribution.
And certainly|We gave|Musa|the Scripture,|so (do) not|be|in|doubt|about|receiving it.|And We made it|a guide|for the Children of Israel.|
And We made|from them|leaders|guiding|by Our Command|when|they were patient|and they were|of Our Verses|certain.
Indeed,|your Lord|[He]|will judge|between them|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection|in what|they used (to)|[in it]|differ.
Does it not|guide|[for] them,|(that) how many|We have destroyed|before them||of|the generations,|they walk about|in|their dwellings.|Indeed,|in|that|surely, are Signs.|Then do not|they hear?
Do not|they see|that We|drive|water|to|the land|[the] barren,|then We bring forth|thereby|crops,|eat|from it|their cattle|and they themselves?|Then do not|they see?
And they say,|"When (will be)|this|decision,|if|you are|truthful?"
Say,|"(On the) Day|(of) the Decision,|not|will benefit|those who|disbelieve|their belief|and not|they|will be granted respite."
So turn away|from them|and wait.|Indeed, they|(are) waiting.
O Prophet ||Fear|Allah|and (do) not|obey|the disbelievers|and the hypocrites.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Knower,|All-Wise.
And follow|what|is inspired|to you|from|your Lord.|Indeed,|Allah|is|of what|you do|All-Aware.
And put your trust|in|Allah.|And Allah is sufficient||(as) Disposer of affairs.
Not|Allah (has) made||for any man|[of]|two hearts|in|his interior.|And not|He (has) made|your wives|whom|you declare unlawful|[of them]|(as) your mothers.|And not|He has made|your adopted sons|your sons.|That|(is) your saying|by your mouths,|but Allah|says|the truth,|and He|guides|(to) the Way.
Call them|by their fathers;|it|(is) more just|near|Allah.|But if|not|you know|their fathers -|then (they are) your brothers|in|[the] religion|and your friends.|But not is|upon you|any blame|in what|you made a mistake|in it,|but|what|intended|your hearts.|And Allah||(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
The Prophet|(is) closer|to the believers|than|their own selves,|and his wives|(are) their mothers.|And possessors|(of) relationships,|some of them|(are) closer|to another|in|(the) Decree|(of) Allah|than|the believers|and the emigrants,|except|that|you do|to|your friends|a kindness.|That is||in|the Book|written.
And when|We took|from|the Prophets|their Covenant|and from you|and from|Nuh|and Ibrahim|and Musa|and Isa,|son|(of) Maryam.|And We took|from them|a covenant|strong
That He may ask|the truthful|about|their truth.|And He has prepared|for the disbelievers|a punishment|painful.
O you|who|believe |Remember|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|upon you|when|came to you|(the) hosts|and  We sent|upon them|a wind|and hosts|not|you (could) see them.|And Allah is||of what|you do|All-Seer.
When|they came upon you|from|above you|and from|below|you,|and when|grew wild|the eyes|and reached|the hearts|the throats,|and you assumed|about Allah|the assumptions.
There -|were tried|the believers|and shaken|(with a) shake|severe.
And when|said|the hypocrites|and those|in|their hearts|(was) a disease,|"Not|Allah promised us||and His messenger|except|delusion."
And when|said|a party|of them,|"O People|(of) Yathrib |No|stand|for you,|so return."|And asked permission|a group|of them|(from) the Prophet,|saying,|"Indeed,|our houses|(are) exposed,"|and not|they|(were) exposed.|Not|they wished|but|to flee.
And if|had been entered|upon them|from|all its sides|then|they had been asked|the treachery,|they (would) have certainly done it|and not|they (would) have hesitated|over it|except|a little.
And certainly|they had|promised|Allah|before,||not|they would turn|their backs.|And is|(the) promise|(to) Allah|to be questioned.
Say,|"Never|will benefit you|the fleeing,|if|you flee|from|death|or|killing,|and then|not|you will be allowed to enjoy|except|a little."
Say,|"Who|(is) it that||(can) protect you|from|Allah|If|He intends|for you|any harm|or|He intends|for you|a mercy?"|And not|they will find|for them|besides||Allah|any protector|and not|any helper.
Verily,|Allah knows||those who hinder|among you|and those who say|to their brothers,|"Come|to us,"|and not|they come|(to) the battle|except|a few,
Miserly|towards you.|But when|comes|the fear,|you see them|looking|at you,|revolving|their eyes|like one who|faints||from|[the] death.|But when|departs|the fear,|they smite you|with tongues|sharp|miserly|towards|the good.|Those -|not|they have believed,|so Allah made worthless||their deeds.|And is|that|for|Allah|easy.
They think|the confederates|(have) not|withdrawn.|And if|(should) come|the confederates|they would wish|if|that they (were)|living in (the) desert|among|the Bedouins,|asking|about|your news.|And if|they were|among you|not|they would fight|except|a little.
Certainly,|is|for you|in|(the) Messenger|(of) Allah|an excellent example||for (one) who|has|hope|(in) Allah|and the Day|the Last,|and remembers|Allah|much.
And when|saw|the believers|the confederates,|they said,|"This|(is) what|Allah promised us||and His Messenger,|and Allah spoke the truth||and His Messenger."|And not|it increased them|except|(in) faith|and submission.
Among|the believers|(are) men|(who) have been true|(to) what|they promised Allah||[on it].|And among them|(is he) who|has fulfilled|his vow|and among them|(is he) who|awaits.|And not|they alter|(by) any alteration -
That Allah may reward||the truthful|for their truth|and punish|the hypocrites|if|He wills|or|turn in mercy|to them.|Indeed,|Allah|is|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
And Allah turned back||those who|disbelieved,|in their rage,|not|they obtained|any good.|And sufficient is|Allah|(for) the believers|(in) the battle,|and Allah is||All-Strong,|All-Mighty.
And He brought down|those who|backed them|among|(the) People|(of) the Scripture|from|their fortresses|and cast|into|their hearts|[the] terror,|a group|you killed|and you took captive|a group.
And He caused you to inherit|their land,|and their houses,|and their properties|and a land|not|you (had) trodden.|And Allah is||on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
O Prophet ||Say|to your wives,|"If|you|desire|the life|(of) the world|and its adornment,|then come,|I will provide for you|and release you|(with) a release|good.
But if|you|desire|Allah|and His Messenger|and the Home|(of) the Hereafter,|then indeed,|Allah|has prepared|for the good-doers|among you|a reward|great."
O wives|(of) the Prophet |Whoever|commits|from you|immorality|clear,|will be doubled|for her|the punishment|two fold.|And that is||for|Allah|easy.
And whoever|is obedient|among you|to Allah|and His Messenger|and does|righteousness,|We will give her|her reward|twice;|and We have prepared|for her|a provision|noble.
O wives|(of) the Prophet |You are not|like anyone|among|the women.|If|you fear (Allah),|then (do) not|be soft|in speech,|lest should be moved with desire|he who,|in|his heart|(is) a disease,|but say|a word|appropriate.
And stay|in|your houses|and (do) not|display  yourselves|(as was the) display|(of the times of) ignorance|the former.|And establish|the prayer|and give|zakah|and obey|Allah|and His Messenger.|Only|Allah wishes||to remove|from you|the impurity,|(O) People|(of) the House |And to purify you|(with thorough) purification.
And remember|what|is recited|in|your houses|of|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|and the wisdom.|Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Subtle,|All-Aware.
Indeed,|the Muslim men|and the Muslim women,|and the believing men|and the believing women,|and the obedient men|and the obedient women,|and the truthful men|and the truthful women,|and the patient men|and the patient women,|and the humble men|and the humble women,|and the men who give charity|and the women who give charity,|and the men who fast|and the women who fast,|and the men who guard|their chastity|and the women who guard (it),|and the men who remember|Allah|much|and the women who remember|Allah has prepared||for them|forgiveness|and a reward|great.
And not|(it) is|for a believing man|and not|(for) a believing woman,|when|Allah has decided||and His Messenger|a matter|that|(there) should be|for them|(any) choice|about|their affair.|And whoever|disobeys|Allah|and His Messenger|certainly,|he (has) strayed|(into) error|clear.
And when|you said|to the one,|Allah bestowed favor||on him|and you bestowed favor|on him,|"Keep|to yourself|your wife|and fear|Allah."|But you concealed|within|yourself|what|Allah|(was to) disclose.|And you fear|the people,|while Allah|has more right|that|you (should) fear Him.|So when|ended|Zaid|from her|necessary (formalities),|We married her to you|so that|not|there be|on|the believers|any discomfort|concerning|the wives|(of) their adopted sons|when|they have ended|from them|necessary (formalities).|And is|(the) Command|(of) Allah|accomplished.
Not|(there can) be|upon|the Prophet|any|discomfort|in what|Allah has imposed||on him.|(That is the) Way|(of) Allah|concerning|those who|passed away|before.||And is|(the) Command|(of) Allah|a decree|destined.
Those who|convey|(the) Messages|(of) Allah|and fear Him|and (do) not|fear|anyone|except|Allah.|And sufficient is Allah||(as) a Reckoner.
Not|is|Muhammad|(the) father|(of) anyone|of|your men|but|(he is the) Messenger|(of) Allah|and Seal|(of) the Prophets.|And Allah is||of every|thing|All-Knower.
O you who believe |||Remember|Allah|(with) remembrance|much
And glorify Him|morning|and evening.
He|(is) the One Who|sends His blessings|upon you|and His Angels|so that He may bring you out|from|the darkness[es]|to|the light.|And He is|to the believers|Merciful.
Their greetings|(on the) Day|they will meet Him|(will be), "Peace."|and He has prepared|for them|a reward|noble.
O Prophet ||Indeed, We|have sent you|(as) a witness|and a bearer of glad tidings|and (as) a warner
And as one who invites|to|Allah|by His permission,|and (as) a lamp|illuminating.
And give glad tidings|(to) the believers|that|for them|(is) from|Allah|a Bounty|great.
And (do) not|obey|the disbelievers|and the hypocrites,|and disregard|their harm,|and put your trust|in|Allah.|And sufficient is Allah||(as) a Trustee.
O you who believe |||When|you marry|believing women|and then,|divorce them|before||[that]|you have touched them,|then not|for you|on them|any|waiting period|(to) count concerning them.|So provide for them|and release them|(with) a release|good.
O Prophet ||Indeed, We|[We] have made lawful|to you|your wives|(to) whom|you have given|their bridal money|and whom|you rightfully possess||from those (whom)|Allah has given||to you,|and (the) daughters|(of) your paternal uncles|and (the) daughters|(of) your paternal aunts|and (the) daughters|(of) your maternal uncles|and (the) daughters|(of) your maternal aunts|who|emigrated|with you,|and a woman|believing|if|she gives|herself|to the Prophet|if|wishes|the Prophet|to|marry her -|only|for you,|excluding||the believers.|Certainly,|We know|what|We have made obligatory|upon them|concerning|their wives|and whom|they rightfully possess,||that not|should be|on you|any discomfort.|And Allah is||Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful
You may defer|whom|you will|of them|or you may take|to yourself|whom|you will.|And whoever|you desire|of those whom|you (had) set aside-|then (there is) no|blame|upon you.|That|(is) more suitable|that|may be cooled|their eyes|and not|they grieve|and they may be pleased|with what|you have given them -|all of them.|And Allah|knows|what|(is) in|your hearts.|And Allah is||All-Knower,|Most Forbearing.
(It is) not|lawful|for you|(to marry) women|after (this)||and not|to|exchange|them|for|(other) wives|even if|pleases you|their beauty,|except|whom|you rightfully possess||And Allah is||over|all|things|an Observer.
O you who believe |||(Do) not|enter|(the) houses|(of) the Prophet|except|when|permission is given|to you|for|a meal,|without|awaiting|its preparation.|But|when|you are invited,|then enter;|and when|you have eaten,|then disperse|and not|seeking to remain|for a conversation.|Indeed,|that|was|troubling|the Prophet,|and he is shy|of (dismissing) you.|But Allah|is not shy||of|the truth.|And when|you ask them|(for) anything|then ask them|from|behind|a screen.|That|(is) purer|for your hearts|and their hearts.|And not|is|for you|that|you trouble|(the) Messenger|(of) Allah|and not|that|you should marry|his wives|after him,||ever.|Indeed,|that|is|near|Allah|an enormity.
Whether|you reveal|a thing|or|conceal it,|indeed,|Allah|is|of all|things|All-Knower.
(There is) no|blame|upon them|concerning|their fathers|and not|their sons|and not|their brothers|and not|sons|(of) their brothers|and not|sons|(of) their sisters|and not|their women|and not|what|they rightfully possess.||And fear|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|is|over|all|things|a Witness.
Indeed,|Allah|and His Angels|send blessings|upon|the Prophet.|O you who believe |||Send blessings|on him|and greet him|(with) greetings.
Indeed,|those who|annoy|Allah|and His Messenger,|Allah has cursed them||in|the world|and the Hereafter|and prepared|for them|a punishment|humiliating.
And those who|harm|the believing men|and the believing women|for other than|what|they have earned,|then certainly,|they bear|false accusation|and sin|manifest.
O Prophet ||Say|to your wives|and your daughters|and (the) women|(of) the believers|to draw|over themselves|[of]|their outer garments.|That|(is) more suitable|that|they should be known|and not|harmed.|And is|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
If|(do) not|cease|the hypocrites|and those who|in|their hearts|(is) a disease|and those who spread rumors|in|the city,|We will let you overpower them,||then|not|they will remain your neighbors|therein|except|(for) a little,
Accursed,|wherever|they are found,|they are seized|and massacred completely.|
(Such is the) Way|(of) Allah|with|those who|passed away|before||and never|you will find|in (the) Way|(of) Allah|any change.
Ask you|the people|about|the Hour.|Say,|"Only|its knowledge|(is) with|Allah.|And what|will make you know?|Perhaps|the Hour|is|near."
Indeed,|Allah|has cursed|the disbelievers|and has prepared|for them|a Blaze,
Abiding|therein|forever,|not|they will find|any protector|and not|any helper.
(The) Day|will be turned about|their faces|in|the Fire|they will say,|"O we wish|we (had) obeyed|Allah|and obeyed|the Messenger "
And they will say,|"Our Lord |Indeed, we|[we] obeyed|our chiefs|and our great men,|and they misled us|(from) the Way.
Our Lord |Give them|double|[of]|punishment|and curse them|(with) a curse|great."
O you who believe |||(Do) not|be|like those who|abused|Musa|then Allah cleared him||of what|they said.|And he was|near|Allah|honorable.
O you who believe |||Fear|Allah|and speak|a word|right.
He will amend|for you|your deeds|and forgive|for you|your sins.|And whoever|obeys|Allah|and His Messenger|certainly|has attained|an attainment|great.
Indeed, We|[We] offered|the Trust|to|the heavens|and the earth|and the mountains,|but they refused|to|bear it|and they feared|from it;|but bore it|the man.|Indeed, he|was|unjust|ignorant.
So that Allah may punish||the hypocrite men|and the hypocrite women|and the polytheist men|and the polytheist women|and Allah will turn (in Mercy)||to|the believing men|and the believing women.|And Allah is||Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
All praises|(be) to Allah|the One to Whom belongs||whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth,|and for Him|(are) all praises|In|the Hereafter.|And He|(is) the All-Wise,|the All-Aware.
He knows|what|penetrates|in|the earth|and what|comes out|from it,|and what|descends|from|the heaven|and what|ascends|therein.|And He|(is) the Most Merciful,|the Oft-Forgiving.
But say|those who|disbelieve,|"Not|will come to us|the Hour."|Say,|"Nay,|by my Lord|surely it will come to you.|(He is the) Knower|(of) the unseen."|Not|escapes|from Him|(the) weight|(of) an atom|in|the heavens|and not|in|the earth|and not|smaller|than|that|and not|greater,|but|(is) in|a Record|Clear.
That He may reward|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds.|Those -|for them|(will be) forgiveness|and a provision|noble.
But those who|strive|against|Our Verses|(to) cause failure -|those -|for them|(is) a punishment|of|foul nature,|painful.
And see|those who|have been given|the knowledge,|(that) what|is revealed|to you|from|your Lord|[it]|(is) the Truth,|and it guides|to|(the) Path|(of) the All-Mighty,|the Praiseworthy.
But say|those who|disbelieve,|"Shall|we direct you|to|a man|who informs you|when|you have disintegrated|(in) total|disintegration,|indeed you|surely (will be) in|a creation|new?
Has he invented|about|Allah|a lie|or|in him|(is) madness?"|Nay,|those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter|(will be) in|the punishment|and error|far.
Then, do not|they see|towards|what|(is) before them||and what|(is) behind them|of|the heaven|and the earth?|If|We will|We (could) cause to swallow them||the earth|or|cause to fall|upon them|fragments|from|the sky.|Indeed,|in|that|surely, is a Sign|for every|slave|who turns (to Allah).
And certainly,|We gave|Dawood|from Us|Bounty.|"O mountains |Repeat praises|with him,|and the birds."|And We made pliable|for him|[the] iron,
That|make|full coats of mail|and measure precisely|[of]|the links (of armor),|and work|righteousness.|Indeed, I Am|of what|you do|All-Seer.
And to Sulaiman,|the wind -|its morning course|(was) a month|and its afternoon course|(was) a month,|and We caused to flow|for him|a spring|(of) molten copper.|And [of]|the jinn|who|worked|before him||by the permission|(of) his Lord.|And whoever|deviated|among them|from|Our Command,|We will make him taste|of|(the) punishment|(of) the Blaze.
They worked|for him|what|he willed|of|elevated chambers|and statues|and bowls|like reservoirs|and cooking-pots|fixed.|"Work,|O family|(of) Dawood |(in) gratitude."|But few|of|My slaves|(are) grateful.
Then when|We decreed|for him|the death,|not|indicated to them|[on]|his death|except|a creature|(of) the earth|eating|his staff.|But when|he fell down,|became clear|(to) the jinn|that|if|they had|known|the unseen,|not|they (would have) remained|in|the punishment|humiliating.
Certainly,|(there) was|for Saba|in|their dwelling place|a sign:|Two gardens|on|(the) right|and (on the) left.|"Eat|from|(the) provision|(of) your Lord|and be grateful|to Him.|A land|good|and a Lord|Oft-Forgiving."
But they turned away,|so We sent|upon them|(the) flood|(of) the dam,|and We changed for them|their two gardens|(with) two gardens|producing fruit||bitter,|and tamarisks|and (some)thing|of|lote trees|few.
That|We recompensed them|because|they disbelieved.|And not|We recompense|except|the ungrateful.
And We made|between them|and between|the towns|which|We had blessed|in it|towns|visible.|And We determined|between them|the journey.|"Travel|between them|(by) night|and (by) day|safely."
But they said,|"Our Lord|lengthen (the distance)|between|our journeys."|And they wronged|themselves,|so We made them|narrations|and We dispersed them|(in) a total|dispersion.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for everyone,|patient|(and) grateful.
And certainly,|found true|about them|Iblis|his assumption,|so they followed him|except|a group|of|the believers.
And not|was|for him|over them|any|authority|except|that We (might) make evident|who|believes|in the Hereafter|from (one) who|[he]|about  it|(is) in|doubt.|And your Lord|over|all|things|(is) a Guardian.
Say,|"Call upon|those whom|you claim|besides||Allah."|Not|they possess|(the) weight|(of) an atom|in|the heavens|and not|in|the earth|and not|for them|in both of them|any|partnership,|and not|for Him|from them|any|supporter.
And not|benefits|the intercession|with Him|except|for (one) whom|He permits|for him.|Until|when|fear is removed|on|their hearts,|they will say,|"What is that -|your Lord has said?"||They will say,|"The truth."|And He|(is) the Most High,|the Most Great.
Say,|"Who|provides (for) you|from|the heavens|and the earth?"|Say,|"Allah.|And indeed, we|or|you|(are) surely upon|guidance|or|in|error|clear."
Say,|"Not|you will be asked|about what|sins we committed|and not|we will be asked|about what|you do."
Say,|"Will gather|us together|our Lord,|then|He will judge|between us|in truth.|And He|(is) the Judge|the All-Knowing."
Say,|"Show me|those whom|you have joined|with Him|(as) partners.|By no means |Nay,|He|(is) Allah|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise."
And not|We have sent you|except|(to) all|mankind|(as) a giver of glad tidings|and (as) a warner.|But|most|[the] people|(do) not|know.
And they say,|"When|(is) this|promise,|if|you are|truthful?"
Say,|"For you|(is the) appointment|(of) a Day,|not|you can postpone|[of] it|(for) an hour,|and not|(can) you precede (it)."
And say|those who|disbelieve,|"Never will|we believe|in this|Quran|and not|in (that) which|(was) before it."||But if|you (could) see|when|the wrongdoers|will be made to stand|before|their Lord,|will throw back|some of them|to|others|the word.|Will say|those who|were oppressed|to those who|were arrogant,|"If not|(for) you|certainly we (would) have been|believers."
Will say|those who|were arrogant|to those|who were oppressed,|"Did we|avert you|from|the guidance|after|when|it had come to you?|Nay,|you were|criminals."
And will say|those who|were oppressed|to those who|were arrogant,|"Nay,|(it was) a plot|(by) night|and (by) day|when|you were ordering us|that|we disbelieve|in Allah|and we set up|for Him|equals."|But they will conceal|the regret|when|they see|the punishment.|And We will put|shackles|on|(the) necks|(of) those who|disbelieved.|Will|they be recompensed|except|(for) what|they used to|do?
And not|We sent|to|a town|any|warner|but|said|its wealthy ones,|"Indeed we,|in what|you have been sent|with,|(are) disbelievers."
And they say,|"We|(have) more|wealth|and children,|and not|we|will be punished."
Say,|"Indeed,|my Lord|extends|the provision|for whom|He wills|and restricts,|but|most|[the] people|(do) not|know."
And not|your wealth|and not|your children|[that]|will bring you close|to Us|(in) position,|but|whoever|believes|and does|righteousness,|then those,|for them|(will be) reward|two-fold|for what|they did,|and they|(will be) in|the high dwellings|secure.
And those who|strive|against|Our Verses|(to) cause failure,|those|into|the punishment|(will be) brought.
Say,|"Indeed,|my Lord|extends|the provision|for whom|He wills|of|His slaves|and restricts|for him.|But what|you spend|of|anything|then He|will compensate it|and He|(is the) Best|(of) the Providers.
And (the) Day|He will gather them|all,|then|He will say|to the Angels,|"Were these you||they were|worshipping?"
They will say,|"Glory be to You |You|(are) our Protector,|not them.||Nay,|they used|(to) worship|the jinn,|most of them|in them|(were) believers."
But today|not|possess power|some of you|on others|to benefit|and not|to harm,|and We will say|to those|who wronged,|"Taste|(the) punishment|(of) the Fire|which|you used|to [it]|deny."
And when|are recited|to them|Our Verses|clear|they say,|"Not|(is) this|but|a man|who wishes|to|hinder you|from what|used|(to) worship|your forefathers."|And they say,|"Not|(is) this|except|a lie|invented."|And said|those who|disbelieved|about the truth|when|it came to them,|"Not|(is) this|except|a magic|obvious."
And not|We (had) given them|any|Scriptures|which they could study,|and not|We sent|to them|before you|any|warner.
And denied|those who|(were) before them||and not|they have attained|a tenth|(of) what|We (had) given them.|But they denied|My Messengers,|so how|was|My rejection?
Say,|"Only|I advise you|for one (thing),|that|you stand|for Allah|(in) pairs|and (as) individuals,|then|reflect."|Not|(is in) your companion|any|madness.|Not|he|(is) except|a warner|for you|before||a punishment|severe."
Say,|"Not|I ask you|for|any payment,|but it (is)|for you.|Not|(is) my payment|but|from|Allah.|And He|(is) over|all|things|a Witness."
Say,|"Indeed,|my Lord|projects|the truth,|(the) All-Knower|(of) the unseen."
Say,|"Has come|the truth|and not|(can) originate|the falsehood|and not|repeat."
Say,|"If|I err,|then only|I will err|against|myself.|But if|I am guided,|then it is by what|reveals|to me|my Lord.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Hearer,|Ever-Near."
And if|you (could) see|when|they will be terrified|but (there will be) no|escape,|and they will be seized|from|a place|near.
And they will say,|"We believe|in it."|But how|for them|(will be) the receiving|from|a place|far off?
And certainly,|they disbelieved|in it|before.||And they utter conjectures|about the unseen|from|a place|far off.
And a barrier will be placed|between them|and between|what|they desire,|as|was done|with their kind|before.||Indeed, they|were|in|doubt|disquieting.
All praises|(be) to Allah,|Creator|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|(Who) makes|the Angels|messengers|having wings||two|or three|or four.|He increases|in|the creation|what|He wills.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
What|Allah grants||to mankind|of|Mercy,|then none|(can) withhold|it.|And what|He withholds,|then none|(can) release|it|thereafter.||And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
O|mankind |Remember|(the) Favor|(of) Allah|upon you.|Is|(there) any|creator|other than Allah||who provides for you|from|the sky|and the earth?|(There is) no|god|but|He.|Then, how|(are) you deluded?
And if|they deny you,|then certainly|were denied|Messengers|before you.||And to|Allah|return|the matters.
O|mankind |Indeed,|(the) promise|(of) Allah|(is) true.|So (let) not|deceive you|the life|(of) the world,|and (let) not|deceive you|about Allah|the Deceiver.
Indeed,|the Shaitaan|(is) to you|an enemy,|so take him|(as) an enemy.|Only|he invites|his party|that they may be|among|(the) companions|(of) the Blaze.
Those who|disbelieve,|for them|(will be) a punishment|severe,|and those|who believe|and do|righteous deeds,|for them|(will be) forgiveness|and a reward|great.
Then is (he) who -|is made fair-seeming|to him|(the) evil|(of) his deed -|so that he sees it|(as) good?|For indeed,|Allah|lets go astray|whom|He wills|and guides|whom|He wills.|So (let) not|go out|your soul|for them|(in) regrets.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knower|of what|they do.
And Allah|(is) the One Who|sends|the winds|so that they raise|(the) clouds,|and We drive them|to|a land|dead|and We revive|therewith|the earth|after|its death.|Thus|(will be) the Resurrection.
Whoever|[is] desires||the honor,|then for Allah|(is) the Honor|all.|To Him|ascends|the words|good,|and the deed|righteous|raises it.|But those who|plot|the evil,|for them|(is) a punishment|severe,|and (the) plotting|(of) those -|it|(will) perish.
And Allah|created you|from|dust,|then|from|a semen-drop;|then|He made you|pairs.|And not|conceives|any|female|and not|gives birth|except|with His knowledge.|And not|is granted life|any|aged person|and not|is lessened|from|his life|but|(is) in|a Register.|Indeed,|that|for|Allah|(is) easy.
And not|are alike|the two seas.|This|(is) fresh,|sweet,|pleasant|its drink,|and this|salty|(and) bitter.|And from|each|you eat|meat|fresh|and you extract|ornaments|you wear them,|and you see|the ships|in it,|cleaving,|so that you may seek|of|His Bounty,|and that you may|be grateful.
He causes to enter|the night|in (to)|the day|and He causes to enter|the day|in (to)|the night,|and He has subjected|the sun|and the moon|each|running|for a term|appointed.|That (is)|Allah,|your Lord,|for Him|(is) the Dominion.|And those whom|you invoke|besides Him,||not|they possess|even|(as much as) the membrane of a date-seed.
If|you invoke them|not|they hear|your call;|and if|they heard,|not|they (would) respond|to you.|And (on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|they will deny|your association.|And none|can inform you|like|(the) All-Aware.
O|mankind |You|(are) those in need|of|Allah,|while Allah,|He|(is) Free of need|the Praiseworthy.
If|He wills,|He (can) do away with you|and bring|in a creation|new.
And not|that|(is) on|Allah|difficult.
And not|will bear|bearer of burdens|burden|(of) another.|And if|calls|a heavily laden|to|(carry) its load,|not|will be carried|of it|anything|even if|he be|near of kin.||Only|you can warn|those who|fear|their Lord -|unseen|and establish|the prayer.|And whoever|purifies himself,|then only|he purifies|for his own self.|And to|Allah|(is) the destination.
And not|equal|(are) the blind|and the seeing,
And not|the darkness[es]|and not|[the] light,
And not|the shade|and not|the heat,
And not|equal|(are) the living|and not|the dead.|Indeed,|Allah|causes to hear|whom|He wills,|and not|you|can make hear|(those) who|(are) in|the graves.
Not|you (are)|but|a warner.
Indeed, We|[We] have sent you|with the truth,|(as) a bearer of glad tidings|and (as) a warner.|And not|(was) any|nation|but|had passed|within it|a warner.
And if|they deny you,|then certainly,|denied|those who|(were) before them.||Came to them|their Messengers|with clear signs|and with Scriptures|and with the Book|[the] enlightening.
Then|I seized|those who|disbelieved,|and how|was|My rejection 
Do not|you see|that|Allah|sends down|from|the sky|water,|then We bring forth|therewith|fruits|(of) various|[their] colors?|And in|the mountains|(are) tracts,|white|and red|(of) various|[their] colors,|and intensely black.|
And among|men|and moving creatures|and the cattle|(are) various|[their] colors|likewise.|Only|fear|Allah|among|His slaves|those who have knowledge.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Mighty,|Oft-Forgiving.
Indeed,|those who|recite|(the) Book|(of) Allah,|and establish|the prayer|and spend|out of what|We have provided them,|secretly|and openly,|hope|(for) a commerce -|never|it will perish.
That He may give them in full|their rewards|and increase for them|of|His Bounty.|Indeed, He|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Appreciative.
And (that) which|We have revealed|to you|of|the Book,|it|(is) the truth|confirming|what (was)|before it.||Indeed,|Allah|of His slaves|surely, (is) All-Aware,|All-Seer.
Then|We caused to inherit|the Book|those whom|We have chosen|of|Our slaves;|and among them|(is he) who wrongs|himself,|and among them|(is he who is) moderate,|and among them|(is he who is) foremost|in good deeds|by permission|(of) Allah.|That|is|the Bounty|the great.
Gardens|(of) Eternity,|they will enter them.|They will be adorned|therein|with|bracelets|of|gold|and pearls,|and their garments|therein|(will be of) silk.
And they (will) say,|"All praises|(be) to Allah|the One Who|(has) removed|from us|the sorrow.|Indeed,|our Lord|(is) surely Oft-Forgiving,|Most Appreciative,
The One Who|has settled us|(in) a Home|(of) Eternity|(out) of|His Bounty.|Not|touches us|therein|any fatigue|and not|touches us|therein|weariness."
And those who|disbelieve,|for them|(will be the) Fire|(of) Hell.|Not|is decreed|for them|that they die,|and not|will be lightened|for them|of|its torment.|Thus|We recompense|every|ungrateful one.
And they|will cry|therein,|"Our Lord |Bring us out;|we will do|righteous (deeds)|other than|(that) which|we used|(to) do."|Did not|We give you life long enough|that|(would) receive admonition|therein|whoever|receives admonition?|And came to you|the warner.|So taste,|then not|(is) for the wrongdoers|any|helper.
Indeed,|Allah|(is the) Knower|(of the) unseen|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|Indeed, He|(is the) All-Knower|of what (is) in the breasts.|
He|(is) the One Who|made you|successors|in|the earth.|And whoever|disbelieves,|then upon him|(is) his disbelief.|And not|increase|the disbelievers|their disbelief|near|their Lord,|except|(in) hatred;|and not|increase|the disbelievers|their disbelief|except|(in) loss.
Say,|"Have you seen|your partners|those whom|you call|besides||Allah?"|Show Me|what|they have created|from|the earth,|or|for them|(is) a share|in|the heavens.|Or|have We given them|a Book|so they|(are) on|a clear proof|therefrom?|Nay,|not|promise|the wrongdoers|some of them|(to) others|except|delusion.
Indeed,|Allah|upholds|the heavens|and the earth,|lest|they cease.|And if|they should cease,|not|can uphold them|any|one|after Him.||Indeed, He|is|Most Forbearing,|Oft-Forgiving.
And they swore|by Allah|(the) strongest|(of) their oaths|that if|came to them|a warner,|surely, they would be|more guided|than|any|(of) the nations.|But when|came to them|a warner,|not|it increased them|but|(in) aversion,
(Due to) arrogance|in|the land|and plotting|(of) the evil;|but not|encompasses|the plot|(of) the evil|except|its own people.|Then do|they wait|except|(the) way|(of) the former (people)?|But never|you will find|in (the) way|(of) Allah|any change,|and never|you will find|in (the) way|(of) Allah|any alteration.
Have they not|traveled|in|the land|and seen|how|was|(the) end|(of) those who|(were) before them?||And they were|stronger|than them|(in) power.|But not|is|Allah|that can escape (from) Him|any|thing|in|the heavens|and not|in|the earth.|Indeed, He|is|All-Knower,|All-Powerful.
And if|Allah (were to) punish||the people|for what|they have earned,|not|He would leave|on|its back|any|creature.|But|He gives them respite|till|a term|appointed.|And when|comes|their term,|then indeed,|Allah|is|of His slaves|All-Seer.
Ya Seen.
By the Quran|the Wise.
Indeed, you|(are) among|the Messengers,
On|a Path|Straight.
A revelation|(of) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful,
That you may warn|a people|not|were warned|their forefathers,|so they|(are) heedless.
Certainly,|(has) proved true|the word|upon|most of them|so they|(do) not|believe.
Indeed, We|[We] have placed|on|their necks|iron collars,|and they|(are up)to|the chins,|so they|(are with) heads raised up.
And We have made|before them|||a barrier|and behind them||a barrier.|and  We covered them,|so they|(do) not|see.
And it (is) same|to them|whether you warn them|or|(do) not|warn them,|not|they will believe.
Only|you (can) warn|(him) who|follows|the Reminder|and fears|the Most Gracious|in the unseen.|So give him glad tidings|of forgiveness|and a reward|noble.
Indeed, We|[We]|[We] give life|(to) the dead|and We record|what|they have sent before|and their footprints,|and every|thing|We have enumerated it|in|a Register|clear.
And set forth|to them|an example|(of the) companions|(of) the city,|when|came to it|the Messengers,
When|We sent|to them|two (Messengers)|but they denied both of them,|so We strengthened them|with a third,|and they said,|"Indeed, We|to you|(are) Messengers."
They said,|"Not|you|(are) but|human beings|like us,|and not|has revealed|the Most Gracious|any|thing.|Not|you|(are) but|lying."
They said,|"Our Lord,|knows|that we|to you|(are) surely Messengers,
And not|(is) on us|except|the conveyance|clear."
They said,|"Indeed, we|[we] see an evil omen|from you.|If|not|you desist,|surely, we will stone you,|and surely will touch you|from us|a punishment|painful."
They said,|"Your evil omen|(be) with you |Is it because|you are admonished?|Nay,|you|(are) a people|transgressing."
And came|from|(the) farthest end|(of) the city|a man|running.|He said,|"O my People |Follow|the Messengers.
Follow|(those) who|(do) not|ask (of) you|any payment,|and they|(are) rightly guided.
And what|(is) for me|(that) not|I worship|the One Who|created me|and to Whom|you will be returned?
Should I take|besides Him||gods?|If|intends for me|the Most Gracious|any harm|not|will avail|[from] me|their intercession|(in) anything,|and not|they (can) save me.
Indeed, I|then|surely would be in|an error|clear.
Indeed, I|[I] have believed|in your Lord,|so listen to me."
It was said,|"Enter|Paradise."|He said,|"Oh I wish |My people|knew
Of how|has forgiven|me|my Lord|and placed me|among|the honored ones."
And not|We sent down|upon|his people|after him||any|host|from|the heaven,|and not|were We|(to) send down.
Not|it was|but|a shout|one|then behold |They|(were) extinguished.
Alas|for|the servants |Not|came to them|any|Messenger|but|they did|mock at him.|
Do not|they see|how many|We destroyed|before them|of|the generations?|That they|to them|will not return.|
And surely|all|then|together,|before Us|(will be) brought.
And a Sign|for them|(is) the earth|dead.|We give it life|and We bring forth|from it|grain,|and from it|they eat.
And We placed|therein|gardens|of|date-palms|and grapevines,|and We caused to gush forth|in it|of|the springs,
That they may eat|of|its fruit.|And not|made it|their hands.|So will not|they be grateful?
Glory be|(to) the One Who|created|(in) pairs|all|of what|grows|the earth|and of|themselves,|and of what|not|they know.
And a Sign|for them|(is) the night.|We withdraw|from it|the day.|Then behold |They|(are) those in darkness.
And the sun|runs|to a term appointed|for it.|That|(is the) Decree|(of) the All-Mighty,|the All-Knowing.
And the moon -|We have ordained for it|phases|until,|it returns|like the date stalk,|the old.
Not|the sun|is permitted|for it -|that|it overtakes|the moon,|and not|the night|(can) outstrip|the day,|but all|in|an orbit|they are floating.
And a Sign|for them|(is) that|We carried|their offspring|in|the ship|laden.
And We created|for them|from|(the) likes of it|what|they ride.
And if|We will,|We could drown them;|then not|(would be) a responder to a cry|for them,|and not|they|would be saved,
Except|(by) Mercy|from Us|and provision|for|a time.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Fear|what|(is) before you||and what|(is) behind you|so that you may|receive mercy."
And not|comes to them|of|a Sign|from|(the) Signs|(of) their Lord,|but|they|from it|turn away.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Spend|from what|(has) provided you|Allah."|Said|those who|disbelieved|to those who|believed,|"Should we feed|whom|if|Allah willed -||He would have fed him?"|Not|(are) you|except|in|an error|clear.
And they say,|"When (is)|this|promise,|if|you are|truthful?"
Not|they await|except|a shout|one,|it will seize them|while they|are disputing.
Then not|they will be able|(to) make a will,|and not|to|their people|they (can) return.
And will be blown|[in]|the trumpet,|and behold |They|from|the graves|to|their Lord|[they] will hasten.
They [will] say,|"O woe to us |Who|has raised us|from|our sleeping place?"|"This (is)|what|(had) promised|the Most Gracious,|and told (the) truth|the Messengers."
Not|it will be|but|a shout|single,|so behold |They|all|before Us|(will be) brought.
So this Day|not|will be wronged|a soul|(in) anything|and not|you will be recompensed|except|(for) what|you used (to)|do.
Indeed,|(the) companions|(of) Paradise|this Day|[in]|will be occupied|(in) amusement,
They|and their spouses|in|shades,|on|[the] couches|reclining.
For them|therein|(are) fruits,|and for them|(is) whatever|they call for.
"Peace."|A word|from|a Lord|Most Merciful.
"But stand apart|today,|O criminals |
Did not|I enjoin|upon you|O Children of Adam ||That|(do) not|worship|the Shaitaan,|indeed, he|(is) for you|an enemy|clear,
And that|you worship Me?|This|(is) a Path|Straight.
And indeed,|he led astray|from you|a multitude|great.|Then did not|you|use reason?
This (is)|(the) Hell|which|you were|promised.
Burn therein|today|because|you used (to)|disbelieve."
This Day|We will seal|[on]|their mouths,|and will speak to Us|their hands,|and will bear witness|their feet|about what|they used (to)|earn.
And if|We willed,|We (would have) surely obliterated|[over]|their eyes,|then they (would) race|(to find) the path,|then how|(could) they see?
And if|We willed|surely, We (would have) transformed them|in|their places|then not|they would have been able|to proceed|and not|return.
And (he) whom|We grant him long life,|We reverse him|in|the creation.|Then will not|they use intellect?
And not|We taught him|[the] poetry,|and not|it is befitting|for him.|Not|it|(is) except|a Reminder|and a Quran|clear,
To warn|(him) who|is|alive|and may be proved true|the Word|against|the disbelievers.
Do not|they see|that We|[We] created|for them|from what|have made|Our hands,|cattle,|then they|[for them]|(are the) owners?
And We have tamed them|for them,|so some of them -|they ride them,|and some of  them|they eat.
And for them|therein|(are) benefits|and drinks,|so (will) not|they give thanks?
But they have taken|besides||Allah|gods,|that they may|be helped.
Not|they are able|to help them,|but they -|for them|(are) hosts|(who will) be brought.
So (let) not|grieve you|their speech.|Indeed, We|[We] know|what|they conceal|and what|they declare.
Does not|see|[the] man|that We|[We] created him|from|a semen-drop.|Then behold |He|(is) an opponent|clear.
And he sets forth|for Us|an example|and forgets|his (own) creation.|He says,|"Who|will give life|(to) the bones|while they|(are) decomposed?"
Say,|"He will give them life|Who|produced them|(the) first|time;|and He|(is) of every|creation|All-Knower."
The One Who|made|for you|from|the tree|[the] green -|fire,|and behold |You|from it|ignite.
Is it not|(He) Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|Able|to|[that]|create|(the) like of them.|Yes, indeed |and He|(is) the Supreme Creator,|the All-Knower.
Only|His Command|when|He intends|a thing|that|He says|to it,|"Be,"|and it is.
So glory be|(to) the One Who -|in Whose hand|is (the) dominion|(of) all|things,|and to Him|you will be returned.
By those lined|(in) rows,
And those who drive|strongly,
And those who recite|(the) Message,
Indeed,|your Lord|(is) surely One,
Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and what|(is) between both of them|and Lord|(of) each point of sunrise.
Indeed, We|[We] adorned|the heaven|[the world]|with an adornment|(of) the stars.
And (to) guard|against|every|devil|rebellious,
Not|they may listen|to|the assembly|[the] exalted,|are pelted|from|every|side,
Repelled;|and for them|(is) a punishment|perpetual,
Except|(him) who|snatches|(by) theft|but follows him|a burning flame,|piercing.
Then ask them,|"Are they|a stronger|creation|or|(those) whom|We have created?"|Indeed, We|created them|from|a clay|sticky.
Nay,|you wonder,|while they mock.
And when|they are reminded,|not|they receive admonition.
And when|they see|a Sign,|they mock,
And they say,|"Not|(is) this|except|a magic|clear.
Is it when|we are dead|and have become|dust|and bones,|shall we then|be certainly resurrected,
Or our fathers|former?"
Say,|"Yes,|and you|(will be) humiliated."
Then only|it|(will be) a cry|single,|then, behold |They|will see.
And they will say,|"O woe to us |This|(is the) Day|(of) the Recompense."
"This|(is the) Day|(of) Judgment|which|you used to|[of it]|deny."
Gather|those who|wronged,|and their kinds|and what|they used (to)|worship
Besides||Allah,|then lead them|to|(the) Path|(of) the Hellfire.
And stop them;|indeed, they|(are) to be questioned."
"What|(is) for you?|(Why) not|you help one another?"
Nay,|they|(on) that Day|(will) surrender.
And will approach|some of them|to|others|questioning one another.
They will say,|"Indeed, you|[you] used (to)|come (to) us|from|the right."
They will say,|"Nay,|not|you were|believers,
And not|was|for us|over you|any|authority.|Nay,|you were|a people|transgressing.
So has been proved true|against us|(the) Word|(of) our Lord;|indeed, we|(will) certainly taste.
So we led you astray;|indeed, we|were|astray."
Then indeed, they|that Day|in|the punishment|(will be) sharers.
Indeed, We|thus,|We deal|with the criminals.
Indeed, they|were,|when|it was said|to them,|"(There is) no|god|except|Allah,"|were arrogant
And they say,|"Are we|to leave|our gods|for a poet|mad?"
Nay,|he has brought|the truth|and confirmed|the Messengers.
Indeed, you|(will) surely taste|the punishment|painful,
And not|you will be recompensed|except|what|you used to|do,
Except|(the) slaves|(of) Allah|the chosen ones.
Those|for them|(will be) a provision|determined,
Fruits|and they|(will) be honored
In|Gardens|(of) Delight
On|thrones|facing each other.
Will be circulated|among them|a cup|from|a flowing spring,
White,|delicious|for the drinkers;
Not|in it|(is) bad effect|and not|they|from it|will be intoxicated.
And with them|(will be) companions of modest gaze||(having) beautiful eyes,
As if they were|eggs,|well protected.
And (will) approach|some of them|to|others|questioning one another.
Will say|a speaker|among them,|"Indeed, I|had|for me|a companion,
Who (would) say,|'Are you indeed|surely of|those who believe?
Is (it) when|we have died|and become|dust|and bones,|will we|surely be brought to Judgment?'"
He (will) say,|"Will|you|be looking?"
Then he (will) look|and see him|in|(the) midst|(of) the Hellfire.
He (will) say,|"By Allah,|verily,|you almost|ruined me.
And if not|(for the) Grace|(of) my Lord,|certainly, I (would) have been|among|those brought.
Then are not|we|(to) die,
Except|our death|the first,|and not|we|will be punished?"
Indeed,|this|surely|(is) the attainment|great.
For (the) like|(of) this,|let work|the workers.
Is that|better|(as) hospitality|or|(the) tree|(of) Zaqqum?
Indeed, We|[We] have made it|a trial|for the wrongdoers.
Indeed, it|(is) a tree|that grows|in|(the) bottom|(of) the Hellfire,
Its emerging fruit|(is) as if it|(was) heads|(of) the devils.
And indeed, they|(will) surely eat|from it|and fill|with it|(their) bellies.
Then|indeed,|for them|in it|(is) a mixture|of|boiling water.
Then|indeed,|their return|(will) surely be to|the Hellfire.
Indeed, they|found|their fathers|astray.
So they|on|their footsteps|they hastened.
And verily,|went astray|before them|most|(of) the former (people),
And verily,|We sent|among them|warners.
Then see|how|was|(the) end|(of) those who were warned,
Except|(the) slaves|(of) Allah|the chosen ones.
And verily,|called Us|Nuh;|and Best|(are We as) Responders 
And We saved him|and his family|from|the distress,|the great.
And We made|his offspring|[they]|the survivors.
And We left|for him|among|the later generations.
"Peace be|upon|Nuh|among|the worlds."
Indeed, We|thus|[We] reward|the good-doers.
Indeed, he|(was) of|Our slaves|believing.
Then|We drowned|the others.
And indeed,|among|his kind|(was) surely Ibrahim,
When|he came|(to) his Lord|with a heart|sound,
When|he said|to his father|and his people,|"What is it|you worship?
Is it falsehood -|gods|other than|Allah -|(that) you desire?
Then what|(do) you think|about (the) Lord|(of) the worlds?"
Then he glanced|a glance|at|the stars,
And he said,|"Indeed, I am|sick."
So they turned away|from him|departing.
Then he turned|to|their gods|and said,|"Do not|you eat?
What (is)|for you|not|you speak?"
Then he turned|upon them|striking|with the right hand.
Then they advanced|towards him,|hastening.
He said,|"Do you worship|what|you carve
While Allah|created you|and what|you make?"
They said,|"Build|for him|a structure|and throw him|into|the blazing Fire."
And they intended|for him|a plot,|but We made them|the lowest.
And he said,|"Indeed, I am|going|to|my Lord,|He will guide me.
My Lord|grant|me|of|the righteous."
So We gave him the glad tidings|of a boy|forbearing.
Then when|he reached|the (age of) working with him||he said,|"O my son |Indeed, I|have seen|in|the dream|that I am|sacrificing you,|so look|what|you see."|He said,|"O my father |Do|what|you are commanded.|You will find me,|if|Allah wills,||of|the patient ones."
Then when|both of them had submitted|and he put him down|upon his forehead,
And We called out to him|that|"O Ibrahim 
Verily,|you have fulfilled|the vision."|Indeed, We|thus|[We] reward|the good-doers.
Indeed,|this|was surely [it]|the trial|clear.
And We ransomed him|with a sacrifice|great,
And We left|for him|among|the later generations.
"Peace be|on|Ibrahim."
Thus|We reward|the good-doers.
Indeed, he (was)|of|Our slaves|believing.
And We gave him glad tidings|of Ishaq,|a Prophet|among|the righteous.
And We blessed|him|and [on]|Ishaq.|And of|their offspring|(are) good-doers|and unjust|to himself|clear.
And verily,|We conferred Favor|upon|Musa|and Harun.
And We saved both of them|and their people|from|the distress|the great,
And We helped them,|so they became||the victors.
And We gave both of them|the Book|the clear.
And We guided both of them|(to) the Path|the Straight.
And We left|for both of them,|among|the later generations.
"Peace be|upon|Musa|and Harun."
Indeed, We|thus|reward|the good-doers.
Indeed, both of them|(were) of|Our slaves|believing.
And indeed,|Ilyas|(was) surely of|the Messengers.
When|he said|to his people,|"Will not|you fear?
Do you call|Baal|and you forsake|(the) Best|(of) Creators -
Allah,|your Lord|and (the) Lord|(of) your forefathers?"|
But they denied him,|so indeed, they|(will) surely be brought,
Except|(the) slaves|(of) Allah|the chosen ones.
And We left|for him|among|the later generations.
"Peace be|upon|Ilyas."|
Indeed, We|thus|reward|the good-doers.
Indeed, he (was)|of|Our slaves|believing.
And indeed,|Lut|(was) of|the Messengers.
When|We saved him|and his family|all,
Except|an old woman|(was) among|those who remained behind.
Then|We destroyed|the others.
And indeed, you|surely pass|by them|(in the) morning,
And at night.|Then will not|you use reason?
And indeed,|Yunus|(was) surely of|the Messengers.
When|he ran away|to|the ship|laden.
Then he drew lots|and was|of|the losers.
Then swallowed him|the fish,|while he|(was) blameworthy.
And if not|that he|was|of|those who glorify
Certainly, he (would have) remained|in|its belly|until|the Day|they are resurrected.
But We cast him|onto the open shore|while he|(was) ill.
And We caused to grow|over him|a plant|of|gourd.
And We sent him|to|a hundred|thousand|or|more.
And they believed,|so We gave them enjoyment|for|a while.
Then ask them,|"Does your Lord|(have) daughters|while for them|(are) sons?"
Or|did We create|the Angels|females|while they|(were) witnesses?
No doubt,|indeed, they|of|their falsehood|[they] say,
"Allah has begotten,"||and indeed, they|surely (are) liars.
Has He chosen|[the] daughters|over|sons?
What is with you?||How|you judge?
Then will not|you pay heed?
Or|(is) for you|an authority|clear?
Then bring|your book,|if|you are|truthful.
And they have made|between Him|and between|the jinn|a relationship,|but certainly,|know|the jinn|that they|(will) surely be brought.
Glory be|(to) Allah|above what|they attribute,
Except|(the) slaves|(of) Allah|the chosen.
So indeed, you|and what|you worship,
Not|you|from Him|can tempt away (anyone).
Except|who|he|(is) to burn|(in) the Hellfire.
"And not|among us|except|for him|(is) a position|known.
And indeed, we|surely, [we]|stand in rows.
And indeed, we|surely, [we]|glorify (Allah)."
And indeed,|they used to|say,
"If|that|we had|a reminder|from|the former (people),
Certainly, we (would) have been|slaves|(of) Allah|the chosen."
But they disbelieved|in it,|so soon|they will know.
And verily,|has preceded|Our Word|for Our slaves,|the Messengers,
Indeed they,|surely they|(would be) the victorious.
And indeed,|Our hosts|surely, they|(will be) those who overcome.
So turn away|from them|until|a time.
And see them,|so soon|they will see.
Then is (it) for Our punishment|they hasten?
But when|it descends|in their territory,|then evil (will be)|(the) morning|(for) those who were warned.
So turn away|from them|for|a time.
And see,|so soon|they will see.
Glory|(be to) your Lord,|(the) Lord|(of) Honor,|above what|they  attribute.
And peace be|upon|the Messengers.
And all praise|(be) to Allah,|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Saad.|By the Quran|full (of) reminder.|
Nay,|those who|disbelieve|(are) in|self-glory|and opposition.
How many|We destroyed|before them||of|a generation,|then they called out|when there (was) no longer|time|(for) escape.
And they wonder|that|has come to them|a warner|from themselves.|And said|the disbelievers,|"This|(is) a magician,|a liar.
Has he made|the gods|(into) one god?||Indeed|this|(is) certainly a thing|curious."
And went forth|the chiefs|among them|that,|"Continue,|and be patient|over|your gods.|Indeed,|this|(is) certainly a thing|intended.
Not|we heard|of this|in|the religion|the last.|Not|(is) this|but|a fabrication.
Has been revealed|to him|the Message|from|among us?"|Nay,|They|(are) in|doubt|about|My Message.|Nay,|not yet|they have tasted|My punishment.
Or|have they|(the) treasures|(of the) Mercy|(of) your Lord|the All-Mighty,|the Bestower?
Or|for them|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them?|Then let them ascend|by|the means.
Soldiers -|there||(they will be) defeated|among|the companies.
Denied|before them|(the) people|(of) Nuh|and Aad|and Firaun,|(the) owner|(of) the stakes.
And Thamud|and (the) people|(of) Lut|and (the) companions|(of) the wood.|Those|(were) the companies.
Not|all (of them)|but|denied|the Messengers,|so (was) just|My penalty.
And not|await|these|but|a shout|one;|not|for it|any|delay.
And they say,|"Our Lord |Hasten|for us|our share|before|(the) Day|(of) the Account."
Be patient|over|what|they say,|and remember|Our slave,|Dawood,|the possessor of strength.||Indeed, he (was)|repeatedly turning.
Indeed, We|subjected|the mountains|with him|glorifying|in the evening|and [the] sunrise.
And the birds|assembled,|all|with him|repeatedly turning.
And We strengthened|his kingdom|and We gave him|[the] wisdom|and decisive|speech.
And has (there)|come to you|(the) news|(of) the litigants,|when|they climbed over the wall|(of) the chamber?
When|they entered|upon|Dawood|and he was afraid|of them,|they said,|"(Do) not|fear.|(We are) two litigants,|has wronged|one of us|to|another,|so judge|between us|in truth|and (do) not|be unjust|and guide us|to|an even|[the] path.
Indeed,|this|(is) my brother,|he has|ninety-nine||ewe(s)|while I have|ewe|one;|so he said,|'Entrust her to me,'|and he overpowered me|in|[the] speech."
He said,|"Certainly,|he has wronged you|by demanding|your ewe|to|his ewes.|And indeed,|many|of|the partners|certainly oppress|some of them|[on]|another|except|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|and few|(are) they."||And became certain|Dawood|that|We (had) tried him,|and he asked forgiveness|(of) his Lord|and fell down|bowing|and turned in repentance.
So We forgave|for him|that.|And indeed,|for him|with Us|surely is a near access|and a good|place of return.
"O Dawood |Indeed, We|[We] have made you|a vicegerent|in|the earth,|so judge|between|[the] men|in truth|and (do) not|follow|the desire,|for it will lead you astray|from|(the) way|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|those who|go astray|from|(the) way|(of) Allah,|for them|(is) a punishment|severe|because|they forgot|(the) Day|(of) Account."
And not|We created|the heaven|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them|without purpose.|That|(is the) assumption|(of) those who|disbelieve.|So woe|to those|who disbelieve,|from|the Fire.
Or|should We treat|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|like those who spread corruption|in|the earth?|Or|should We treat|the pious|like the wicked?
(This is) a Book|We have revealed it|to you,|blessed,|that they may ponder|(over) its Verses|and may be reminded|those of understanding.|
And We gave|to Dawood|Sulaiman,|an excellent|slave.|Indeed, he|(was) one who repeatedly turned.
When|were displayed|to him|in the afternoon|excellent bred steeds.|
And he said,|"Indeed, I|[I] preferred|(the) love|(of) the good|for|(the) remembrance|(of) my Lord."|Until|they were hidden|in the veil;
"Return them|to me."|Then he began|(to) pass (his hand)|over the legs|and the necks.
And certainly|We tried|Sulaiman,|and We placed|on|his throne|a body;|then|he turned.
He said,|"O my Lord |Forgive|me|and grant|me|a kingdom,|not|(will) belong|to anyone|after me.||Indeed, You|[You]|(are) the Bestower."
Then We subjected|to him|the wind|to flow|by his command,|gently,|wherever|he directed,
And the devils,|every|builder|and diver,
And others|bound|in|chains.
"This|(is) Our gift,|so grant|or|withhold|without|account."
And indeed,|for him|with Us|surely is a near access|and a good|place of return.
And remember|Our slave|Ayyub,|when|he called|his Lord,|"That [I],|(has) touched me|Shaitaan|with distress|and suffering."
"Strike|with your foot.|This|(is a spring of) water to bathe,|cool|and a drink."
And We granted|[to] him|his family|and a like of them|with them,|a Mercy|from Us|and a Reminder|for those of understanding.|
"And take|in your hand|a bunch|and strike|with it|and (do) not|break (your) oath."|Indeed, We|[We] found him|patient,|an excellent|slave.|Indeed, he|repeatedly turned.
And remember|Our slaves|Ibrahim|and Ishaq|and Ayyub,|possessors|(of) strength|and vision.
Indeed, We|[We] chose them|for an exclusive (quality);|remembrance|(of) the Home.
And indeed, they|to Us|(are) from|the chosen ones,|the best.
And remember|Ismail|and Al-Yasa|and Dhul-kifl,||and all|(are) from|the best.
This|(is) a Reminder.|And indeed,|for the righteous|surely, is a good|place of return,
Gardens|(of) Eternity,|(will be) opened|for them|the gates.
Reclining|therein,|they will call|therein|for fruit|many|and drink.
And with them|(will be) companions of modest gaze||well-matched.
This|(is) what|you are promised|for (the) Day|(of) Account.
Indeed,|this|(is) surely Our provision;|not|for it|any|depletion.
This (is so) |And indeed,|for the transgressors|surely (is) an evil|place of return.
Hell;|they will burn therein|and wretched (is)|the resting place.
This (is so) |Then let them taste it,|boiling fluid|and purulence.
And other|of|its type|(of various) kinds.
This|(is) a company|bursting in|(in) with you.|No|welcome|for them.|Indeed, they|(will) burn|(in) the Fire.
They say,|"Nay |You -|no|welcome|for you.|You|brought this|upon us.|So wretched (is)|the settlement."
They will say,|"Our Lord,|whoever|brought|upon us|this;|increase for him|a punishment|double|in|the Fire."
And they (will) say,|"What (is)|for us|not|we see|men|we used to|count them|among|the bad ones?
Did we take them|(in) ridicule|or|has turned away|from them|the vision?"
Indeed,|that|(is) surely (the) truth -|(the) quarreling|(of the) people|(of) the Fire.
Say,|"Only|I am|a warner,|and not|(is there) any|god|except|Allah,|the One|the Irresistible,
Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them,|the All-Mighty,|the Oft-Forgiving."
Say,|"It (is)|a news|great,
You|from it|turn away.
Not|is|for me|any|knowledge|(of) the chiefs,|the exalted|when|they were disputing.
Not|has been revealed|to me|except|that only|I am|a warner|clear."
When|said|your Lord|to the Angels,|"Indeed, I Am|going to create|a human being|from|clay.
So when|I have proportioned him|and breathed|into him|of|My spirit,|then fall down|to him|prostrating."
So prostrated|the Angels|all of them|together.
Except|Iblis;|he was arrogant|and became|of|the disbelievers.
He said,|"O Iblis |What|prevented you|that|you (should) prostrate|to (one) whom|I created|with My Hands?|Are you arrogant|or|are you|of|the exalted ones."
He said,|"I am|better|than him.|You created me|from|fire|and You created him|from|clay."
He said,|"Then get out|of it,|for indeed, you|(are) accursed.
And indeed,|upon you|(is) My curse|until|(the) Day|(of) Judgment."
He said,|"My Lord |Then give me respite|until|(the) Day|they are resurrected."
He said,|"Then indeed, you|(are) of|those given respite,
Until|(the) Day|(of) the time|well-known."
He said,|"Then by Your might|I will surely mislead them|all.
Except|Your slaves|among them|the chosen ones."
He said,|"Then (it is) the truth|and the truth|I say,
Surely I will fill|Hell|with you|and those who|follow you|among them|all."
Say,|"Not|I ask you|for it|any|payment,|and not|I am|of|the ones who pretend.
Not|it (is)|except|a Reminder|to the worlds.
And surely you will know|its information|after|a time."
(The) revelation|(of) the Book|(is) from|Allah|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
Indeed, We|[We] have revealed|to you|the Book|in truth;|so worship|Allah|(being) sincere|to Him|(in) the religion.
Unquestionably,|for Allah|(is) the religion|the pure.|And those who|take|besides Him||protectors,|"Not|we worship them|except|that they may bring us near|to|Allah|(in) nearness."|Indeed,|Allah|will judge|between them|in|what|they|[in it]|differ.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|(one) who|[he]|(is) a liar|and a disbeliever.
If|Allah (had) intended||to|take|a son,|surely, He (could) have chosen|from what|He creates|whatever|He willed.|Glory be to Him |He|(is) Allah|the One,|the Irresistible.
He created|the heavens|and the earth|in [the] truth.|He wraps|the night|over|the day|and wraps|the day|over|the night.|And He subjected|the sun|and the moon,|each|running|for a term|specified.|Unquestionably,|He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Oft-Forgiving.
He created you|from|a soul|single.|Then|He made|from it|its mate.|And He sent down|for you|of|the cattle|eight|kinds.|He creates you|in|(the) wombs|(of) your mothers,|creation|after||creation,|in|darkness[es]|three.|That|(is) Allah|your Lord;|for Him|(is) the dominion.|(There is) no|god|except|He.|Then how|are you turning away?
If|you disbelieve|then indeed,|Allah|(is) free from need|of you.|And not|He likes|in His slaves|ungratefulness.|And if|you are grateful|He likes it|in you.|And not|will bear|bearer of burdens|(the) burden|(of) another.|Then|to|your Lord|(is) your return,|then He will inform you|about what|you used to|do.|Indeed, He|(is) the All-Knower|of what (is) in the breasts.|
And when|touches|[the] man|adversity,|he calls|his Lord|turning|to Him;|then|when|He bestows on him|a favor|from Himself,|he forgets|(for) what|he used to call||[to] Him|before,||and he sets up|to Allah|rivals|to mislead|from|His Path.|Say,|"Enjoy|in your disbelief|(for) a little.|Indeed, you|(are) of|(the) companions|(of) the Fire."
Is (one) who|[he]|(is) devoutly obedient -|(during) hours|(of) the night,|prostrating|and standing,|fearing|the Hereafter|and hoping|(for the) Mercy|(of) his Lord?|Say,|"Are|equal|those who|know|and those who|(do) not|know?"|Only|will take heed|those of understanding.|
Say,|"O My slaves|[those] who|believe |Fear|your Lord.|For those who|do good|in|this|world|(is) good,|and the earth|(of) Allah|(is) spacious.|Only|will be paid back in full|the patient ones|their reward|without|account."
Say,|"Indeed, I|[I] am commanded|that|I worship|Allah,|(being) sincere|to Him|(in) the religion.
And I am commanded|that|I be|(the) first|(of) those who submit."
Say,|"Indeed, I|[I] fear,|if|I disobey|my Lord,|(the) punishment|(of) a Day|great."
Say,|"I worship Allah||(being) sincere|to Him|(in) my religion.
So worship|what|you will|besides Him."||Say,|"Indeed,|the losers|(are) those who|(will) lose|themselves|and their families|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|Unquestionably,|that -|it|(is) the loss|the clear."
For them|from|above them|coverings|of|the Fire|and from|below them|coverings.|(With) that|threatens|Allah|[with it]|His slaves,|"O My slaves |So fear Me."
And those who|avoid|the false gods|lest|they worship them|and turn|to|Allah,|for them|(are) glad tidings.|So give glad tidings|(to) My slaves
Those who|they listen (to)|the Word,|then follow|the best thereof,|those|(are) they whom|Allah has guided them,||and those|are [they]|the men of understanding.|
Then, is (one) who,|became due|on him|the word|(of) the punishment?|Then can you|save|(one) who|(is) in|the Fire?
But|those who|fear|their Lord,|for them|(are) lofty mansions,|above them||lofty mansions|built high,|flow|from|beneath it|the rivers.|(The) Promise|(of) Allah.|Not|Allah fails||(in His) promise.
Do not|you see|that|Allah|sends down|from|the sky|water|and He makes it flow|(as) springs|in|the earth;|then|He produces|with it|crops|(of) different|colors;|then|they wither|and you see it|turn yellow;|then|He makes it|debris?|Indeed,|in|that|surely, (is) a reminder|for those of understanding.|
So is (one for) whom|Allah has expanded||his breast|for Islam|so he|(is) upon|a light|from|his Lord.|So woe|to (those are) hardened|their hearts|from|(the) remembrance of Allah.||Those|(are) in|error|clear.
Allah|has revealed|(the) best|(of) [the] statement -|a Book|(its parts) resembling each other|oft-repeated.|Shiver|from it|(the) skins|(of) those who|fear|their Lord,|then|relax|their skins|and their hearts|at|(the) remembrance|(of) Allah.|That|(is the) guidance|(of) Allah,|He guides|with it|whom|He wills.|And whoever|Allah lets go astray||then not|for him|any|guide.
Then (is) he who|will shield|with his face|(the) worst|punishment|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection?|And it will be said|to the wrongdoers,|"Taste|what|you used to|earn."
Denied|those who|(were) before them,||so came upon them|the punishment|from|where|not|they perceive.
So Allah made them taste||the disgrace|in|the life|(of) the world,|and certainly (the) punishment|(of) the Hereafter|(is) greater,|if|they|knew.
And indeed,|We have set forth|for people|in|this|Quran|of|every|example|so that they may|take heed.
A Quran|(in) Arabic|without|any|crookedness|so that they may|(become) righteous.
Allah sets forth||an example -|a man|about him|partners|quarreling|and a man|(belonging) exclusively|to one man -|are|they both equal|(in) comparison?|All praise|(be) to Allah |Nay,|most of them|(do) not|know.
Indeed, you|(will) die|and indeed, they|(will also) die.
Then|indeed you,|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|before|your Lord,|will dispute.
Then who|(is) more unjust|than (one) who|lies|against|Allah|and denies|the truth|when|it comes to him?|Is (there) not|in|Hell|an abode|for the disbelievers?
And the one who|brought|the truth|and believed|in it,|those|[they]|(are) the righteous.
For them|(is) what|they wish|with|their Lord.|That|(is the) reward|(of) the good-doers
That Allah will remove||from them|(the) worst|(of) what|they did|and reward them|their due|for (the) best|(of) what|they used to|do.
Is not|Allah|sufficient|(for) His slave?|And they threaten you|with those|besides Him.||And whoever|Allah lets go astray -||then not|for him|any|guide.
And whoever|Allah guides,||then not|for him|any|misleader.|Is not|Allah|All-Mighty,|All-Able of retribution?|
And if|you ask them|who|created|the heavens|and the earth?|Surely, they will say,|"Allah."|Say,|"Then do you see|what|you invoke|besides||Allah?|if|Allah intended for me||harm,|are|they|removers|(of) harm (from) Him;|or|if He intended for me|mercy,|are|they|withholders|(of) His mercy?"|Say,|"Sufficient (is) Allah for me;||upon Him|put trust|those who trust."
Say,|"O my people |Work|(according) to|your position,|indeed, I am|working;|then soon|you will know
(Upon) whom|will come|a punishment|disgracing him|and descends|on him|a punishment|everlasting."
Indeed We,|We revealed|to you|the Book|for [the] mankind|in truth.|So whoever|accepts guidance,|then (it is) for his soul;|and whoever|goes astray|then only|he strays|against his (soul).|And not|you|(are) over them|a manager.
Allah|takes|the souls|(at the) time|(of) their death,|and the one who|(does) not|die|in|their sleep.|Then He keeps|the one whom,|He has decreed|for them|the death,|and sends|the others|for|a term|specified.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) signs|for a people|who ponder.
Or|have they taken|besides||Allah|intercessors?|Say,|"Even though|they were|not|possessing|anything,|and not|they understand?"
Say,|"To Allah (belongs)|the intercession|all.|For Him|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|Then|to Him|you will be returned."
And when|Allah is mentioned||Alone,|shrink with aversion|(the) hearts|(of) those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter,|and when|are mentioned|those|besides Him,||behold |They|rejoice.
Say,|"O Allah |Creator|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|Knower|(of) the unseen|and the witnessed,|You|will judge|between|Your slaves|in|what|they used to|therein|differ."
And if||those who|did wrong|(had) whatever|(is) in|the earth|all|and (the) like of it|with it,|they would ransom|with it|from|(the) evil|(of) the punishment|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|And (will) appear|to them|from|Allah|what|not|they had|taken into account.
And will become apparent|to them|(the) evils|(of) what|they earned,|and will surround|them|what|they used to|[in it]|mock.
So when|touches|[the] man|adversity,|he calls upon Us;|then|when|We bestow (on) him|a favor|from Us,|he says,|"Only,|I have been given it|for|knowledge."|Nay,|it|(is) a trial,|but|most of them|(do) not|know.
Indeed,|said it|those|before them,||but (did) not|avail|them|what|they used to|earn.
Then struck them|(the) evils|(of) what|they earned.|And those who|have wronged|of|these,|will strike them|(the) evils|(of) what|they earned;|and not|they|will be able to escape.
Do not|they know|that|Allah|extends|the provision|for whom|He wills|and restricts.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) signs|for a people|who believe.
Say,|"O My slaves |Those who|have transgressed|against|themselves,|(do) not|despair|of|(the) Mercy|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|forgives|the sins|all.|Indeed He,|He|(is) the Oft-Forgiving,|the Most Merciful.
And turn|to|your Lord|and submit|to Him|before||[that]|comes to you|the punishment;|then|not|you will be helped.
And follow|(the) best|(of) what|is revealed|to you|from|your Lord|before||[that]|comes to you|the punishment|suddenly,|while you|(do) not|perceive,
Lest|should say|a soul,|"Oh  My regret|over|what|I neglected|in|regard (to)|Allah|and that|I was|surely, among|the mockers."
Or|it should say,|"If that||Allah|(had) guided me,|surely, I (would) have been|among|the righteous."
Or|it should say|when|it sees|the punishment,|"If|only|for me|another chance|then I could be|among|the good-doers."
"Yes,|verily|came to you|My Verses,|but you denied|them|and were arrogant,|and you were|among|the disbelievers.
And (on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|you will see|those who|lied|about|Allah,|their faces|(will be) blackened.|Is (there) not|in|Hell|an abode|for the arrogant?
And Allah will deliver||those who|feared (Him)|to their place of salvation;|not|will touch them|the evil,|and not|they|will grieve.
Allah|(is the) Creator|(of) all|things,|and He|(is) over|all|things|a Guardian.
For Him|(are the) keys|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|And those who|disbelieve|in (the) Verses|(of) Allah,|those -|they|(are) the losers.
Say,|"Is (it) other than|Allah|you order me|(to) worship,|O|ignorant ones?"
And verily,|it has been revealed|to you|and to|those who|(were) before you,||if|you associate (with Allah)|surely, will become worthless|your deeds|and you will surely be|among|the losers.
Nay |But worship Allah||and be|among|the thankful ones.
And not|they appraised|Allah|(with) true|appraisal,|while the earth|entirely|(will be) in His Grip|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|and the heavens|(will be) folded|in His Right Hand.|Glory be to Him |And High is He|above what|they associate (with Him).
And (will) be blown|[in]|the trumpet,|then (will) fall dead|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and whoever|(is) on|the earth|except|whom|Allah wills.||Then|(it will) be blown|[in it]|a second time,|and behold |They|(will be) standing|waiting.
And (will) shine|the earth|with (the) light|(of) its Lord|and (will) be placed|the Record|and (will) be brought|the Prophets|and the witnesses,|and it (will) be judged|between them|in truth,|and they|will not be wronged.|
And (will) be paid in full|every|soul|what|it did;|and He|(is the) Best-Knower|of what|they do.
And (will) be driven|those who|disbelieve|to|Hell|(in) groups|until|when|they reach it,|(will) be opened|its gates|and (will) say|to them|its keepers,|"Did not|come to you|Messengers|from you|reciting|to you|(the) Verses|(of) your Lord|and warning you|(of the) meeting|(of) your Day|this?"|They (will) say,|"Yes "|But|has been justified|(the) word|(of) punishment|against|the disbelievers.
It will be said,|"Enter|(the) gates|(of) Hell|(to) abide eternally|therein,|and wretched is|(the) abode|(of) the arrogant."
And (will) be driven|those who|feared|their Lord,|to|Paradise|(in) groups|until|when|they reach it|and (will) be opened|its gates|and (will) say|to them|its keepers,|"Peace be|upon you,|you have done well,|so enter it|(to) abide eternally."
And they will say,|"All praise|(be) to Allah,|Who|has fulfilled for us|His promise|and has made us inherit|the earth,|we may settle|in|Paradise|wherever|we wish.|So excellent|(is the) reward|(of) the workers."
And you will see|the Angels|surrounding|[from]|around|the Throne|glorifying|(the) praise|(of) their Lord.|And (will) be judged|between them|in truth,|and it will be said,|"All praise be|to Allah,|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds."
Ha Mim.
(The) revelation|(of) the Book|(is) from|Allah|the All-Mighty,|the All-Knower.
(The) Forgiver|(of) the sin,|and (the) Acceptor|(of) [the] repentance,|severe|(in) the punishment,|Owner (of) the abundance.||(There is) no|god|except|Him;|to Him,|(is) the final return.
Not|dispute|concerning|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|except|those who|disbelieve,|so (let) not|deceive you|their movement|in|the cities.
Denied|before them|(the) people|(of) Nuh|and the factions|after them,||and plotted|every|nation|against their Messenger,|to seize him,|and they disputed|by falsehood|to refute|thereby|the truth.|So I seized them.|Then how|was|My penalty?
And thus|has been justified|(the) Word|(of) your Lord|against|those who|disbelieved|that they|(are) companions|(of) the Fire.
Those who|bear|the Throne|and who|(are) around it|glorify|(the) praises|(of) their Lord|and believe|in Him|and ask forgiveness|for those who|believe,|"Our Lord |You encompass|all|things|(by Your) Mercy|and knowledge,|so forgive|those who|repent|and follow|Your Way|and save them (from)|(the) punishment|(of) the Hellfire.
Our Lord |And admit them|(to) Gardens|(of) Eden|which|You have promised them|and whoever|(was) righteous|among|their fathers|and their spouses|and their offspring.|Indeed You,|You|(are) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
And protect them|(from) the evils.|And whoever|you protect|(from) the evils|that Day,|then verily|You bestowed Mercy on him.|And that|[it]|(is) the success,|the great."
Indeed,|those who|disbelieved|will be cried out to them,|"Certainly Allah's hatred||(was) greater|than|your hatred|(of) yourselves|when|you were called|to|the faith,|and you disbelieved."
They (will) say,|"Our Lord |You gave us death|twice|and You gave us life|twice,|and we confess|our sins.|So is (there)|to|get out|any|way?"
"That|(is) because,|when|Allah was invoked||Alone|you disbelieved;|but if|(others) were associated|with Him,|you believed.|So the judgment|(is) with Allah,|the Most High,|the Most Great."
He|(is) the One Who|shows you|His Signs|and sends down|for you|from|the sky|provision.|But (does) not|take heed|except|(one) who|turns.
So invoke|Allah,|(being) sincere|to Him|(in) the religion,|even though|dislike (it)|the disbelievers.
Possessor of the Highest Ranks,||Owner (of) the Throne;||He places|the inspiration|of|His Command|upon|whom|He wills|of|His slaves,|to warn|(of the) Day|(of) the Meeting.
(The) Day|they|come forth,|not|is hidden|from|Allah|about them|anything.|For whom|(is) the Dominion|this Day?|For Allah|the One,|the Irresistible.
This Day|will be recompensed|every|soul|for what|it earned.|No|injustice|today |Indeed,|Allah|(is) Swift|(in) Account.
And warn them|(of the) Day|the Approaching,|when|the hearts|(are) at|the throats,|choked.|Not|for the wrongdoers|any|intimate friend|and no|intercessor|(who) is obeyed.
He knows|(the) stealthy glance||and what|conceal|the breasts.
And Allah|judges|in truth,|while those (whom)|they invoke|besides Him||not|they judge|with anything.|Indeed,|Allah -|He|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Seer.
Do not|they travel|in|the earth|and see|how|was|(the) end|(of) those who|were|before them?||They were|[they]|superior|to them|(in) strength|and (in) impressions|in|the land,|but Allah seized them||for their sins,|and not|was|for them|against|Allah|any|protector.
That|(was) because [they]|used to come to them||their Messengers|with clear proofs|but they disbelieved,|So Allah seized them.||Indeed, He|(is) All-Strong,|severe|(in) punishment.
And certainly,|We sent|Musa|with Our Signs|and an authority|clear,
To|Firaun,|Haman|and Qarun,|but they said,|"A magician,|a liar."
Then when|he brought to them|the truth|from|Us,|they said,|"Kill|(the) sons|(of) those who|believe|with him,|and let live|their women."|And not|(is the) plot|(of) the disbelievers|but|in|error.
And said|Firaun,|"Leave me|(so that) I kill|Musa|and let him call|his Lord.|Indeed, I|[I] fear|that|he will change|your religion|or|that|he may cause to appear|in|the land|the corruption."
And said|Musa,|"Indeed, I|[I] seek refuge|in my Lord|and your Lord|from|every|arrogant one|not|who believes|(in the) Day|(of) the Account."
And said|a man,|believing,|from|(the) family|(of) Firaun|who conceal(ed)|his faith,|"Will you kill|a man|because|he says,|'My Lord|(is) Allah,'|and indeed|he has brought you|clear proofs|from|your Lord?|And if|he is|a liar,|then upon him|(is) his lie;|and if|he is|truthful,|(there) will strike you|some (of)|(that) which|he threatens you.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|(one) who|[he]|(is) a transgressor,|a liar.
O my people |For you|(is) the kingdom|today,|dominant|in|the land,|but who|will help us|from|(the) punishment|(of) Allah,|if|it came to us."|Said|Firaun,|"Not|I show you|except|what|I see|and not|I guide you|except|(to the) path|the right."
And said|(he) who|believed,|"O my people |Indeed I,|[I] fear|for you|like|(the) day|(of) the companies,
Like|(the) plight|(of the) people|(of) Nuh|and Aad|and Thamud|and those|after them.||And Allah (does) not||want|injustice|for (His) slaves.
And O my people |Indeed, I|[I] fear|for you|(the) Day|(of) Calling,
A Day|you will turn back|fleeing;|not|for you|from|Allah|any|protector.|And whoever|Allah lets go astray,||then not|for him|any|guide.
And indeed,|came to you|Yusuf|before||with clear proofs,|but not|you ceased|in|doubt|about what|he brought to you|[with it],|until|when|he died,|you said,|'Never|will Allah raise||after him||a Messenger.'|Thus,|Allah lets go astray||who|[he]|(is) a transgressor,|a doubter."
Those who|dispute|concerning|(the) Signs|(of) Allah|without|any authority|(having) come to them,|(it) is greatly|hateful|near Allah||and near|those|who believe.|Thus|Allah sets a seal||over|every|heart|(of) an arrogant|tyrant."
And said|Firaun,|"O Haman |Construct|for me|a tower|that I may|reach|the ways
(The) ways|(to) the heavens|so I may look|at|(the) God|(of) Musa;|and indeed, I|[I] surely think him|(to be) a liar."|And thus|was made fair-seeming|to Firaun|(the) evil|(of) his deed,|and he was averted|from|the way.|And not|(was the) plot|(of) Firaun|except|in|ruin.
And said|the one who|believed,|"O my people |Follow me;|I will guide you|(to the) way,|the right.
O my people |Only|this,|the life|(of) the world,|(is) enjoyment,|and indeed,|the Hereafter -|it|(is the) home,|(of) settlement.
Whoever|does|an evil|then not|he will be recompensed|but|(the) like thereof;|and whoever|does|righteous(deeds),|of|male|or|female,|while he|(is) a believer,|then those|will enter|Paradise,|they will be given provision|in it|without|account.
And O my people |What (is)|for me|(that) I call you|to|the salvation|while you call me|to|the Fire 
You call me|that I disbelieve|in Allah|and (to) associate|with Him|what|not|for me|of it|any knowledge,|and I|call you|to|the All-Mighty,|the Oft-Forgiving.
No|doubt|that what|you call me|to it|not|for it|a claim|in|the world|and not|in|the Hereafter;|and that|our return|(is) to|Allah,|and that|the transgressors -|they|(will be the) companions|(of) the Fire.
And you will remember|what|I say|to you,|and I entrust|my affair|to|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Seer|of (His) slaves."
So Allah protected him||(from the) evils|that|they plotted,|and enveloped|(the) people|(of) Firaun|(the) worst|punishment,
The Fire;|they are exposed|to it|morning|and evening.|And (the) Day|(will be) established|the Hour,|"Cause to enter|(the) people|(of) Firaun|(in the) severest|punishment."
And when|they will dispute|in|the Fire,|then will say|the weak|to those who|were arrogant,|"Indeed, we|[we] were|for you|followers,|so can|you|avert|from us|a portion|of|the Fire?"
Will say|those who|(were) arrogant,|"Indeed, we|all|(are) in it.|Indeed,|Allah|certainly|has judged|between|(His) slaves."
And will say|those|in|the Fire|to (the) keepers|(of) Hell,|"Call|your Lord|(to) lighten|for us|a day|of|the punishment."
They (will) say,|"Did there not||come to you|your Messengers|with clear proofs?"|They (will) say,|"Yes."|They (will) say,|"Then call,|but not|(is the) call|(of) the disbelievers|except|in|error."
Indeed We,|We will surely help|Our Messengers|and those who|believe|in|the life|(of) the world|and (on the) Day|(when) will stand|the witnesses,
(The) Day|not|will benefit|the wrongdoers|their excuse,|and for them|(is) the curse|and for them|(is the) worst|home.
And certainly,|We gave|Musa|the guidance|and We caused to inherit|(the) Children of Israel||the Book,
A guide|and a reminder|for those|(of) understanding.
So be patient;|indeed,|(the) Promise of Allah||(is) true.|And ask forgiveness|for your sin|and glorify|(the) praise|(of) your Lord|in the evening|and the morning.
Indeed,|those who|dispute|concerning|(the) Signs|(of) Allah|without|any authority|(which) came to them,|not|(is) in|their breasts|but|greatness,|not|they|(can) reach it.|So seek refuge|in Allah.|Indeed He,|He|(is) the All-Hearer|the All-Seer.
Surely, (the) creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth|(is) greater|than|(the) creation|(of) the mankind,|but|most|(of) the people|(do) not|know.
And not|(are) equal|the blind|and the seeing|and those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|and not|the evildoer.|(is) what|Little|you take heed.
Indeed,|the Hour|(is) surely coming,|no|doubt|in it,|but|most|(of) the people|(do) not|believe.
And said|your Lord,|"Call upon Me;|I will respond|to you.|Indeed,|those who|(are) proud|to|worship Me|will enter|Hell|(in) humiliation."
Allah|(is) the One Who|made|for you|the night|that you may rest|in it,|and the day|giving visibility.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Full (of) Bounty||to|the people,|but|most|(of) the people|(do) not|give thanks.
That|(is) Allah|your Lord,|(the) Creator|(of) all|things,|(there is) no|god|except|Him.|So how|are you deluded?
Thus|were deluded|those who|were -|(the) Signs|(of) Allah,|rejecting.
Allah|(is) the One Who|made|for you|the earth|a place of settlement|and the sky|a canopy|and He formed you|and perfected|your forms,|and provided you|of|the good things.|That|(is) Allah,|your Lord.|Then blessed (is)|Allah,|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
He|(is) the Ever-Living;|(there is) no|god|but|He,|so call Him,|(being) sincere|to Him|(in) the religion.|All praise (be)|to Allah,|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Say,|"Indeed, I|[I] have been forbidden|to|worship|those whom|you call|besides||Allah|when|have come to me|the clear proofs|from|my Lord,|and I am commanded|to|submit|to (the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
He|(is) the One Who|created you|from|dust,|then|from|a semen-drop,|then|from|a clinging substance,|then|He brings you out|(as) a child;|then|lets you reach|your maturity,|then|lets you become|old -|and among you|(is he) who|dies|before -||and lets you reach|a term|specified,|and that you may|use reason.
He|(is) the One Who|gives life|and causes death.|And when|He decrees|a matter,|then only|He says|to it,|"Be,"|and it is.
Do not|you see|[to]|those who|dispute|concerning|(the) Signs|(of) Allah?|How|they are turned away?
Those who|deny|the Book|and with what|We sent|with it|Our Messengers;|but soon|they will know.
When|the iron collars|(will be) around|their necks|and the chains,|they will be dragged,
In|the boiling water;|then|in|the Fire|they will be burned.
Then|it will be said|to them,|"Where|(is) that which|you used to|associate
Other than||Allah?"|They will say,|"They have departed|from us.|Nay |Not|we used to|[we] call|before||anything."|Thus|Allah lets go astray||the disbelievers.
"That was|because|you used to|rejoice|in|the earth|without|right|and because|you used to|be insolent.
Enter|(the) gates|(of) Hell|(to) abide forever|in it,|and wretched is|(the) abode|(of) the arrogant."
So be patient;|indeed,|(the) Promise|(of) Allah|(is) true.|And whether|We show you|some|(of) what|We have promised them|or|We cause you to die,|then to Us|they will be returned.
And certainly|We have sent|Messengers|before you.||Among them|(are) who -|We have related|to you,|and among them|(are) who -|not|We have related|to you.|And not|is|for any Messenger|that|he brings|a Sign|except|by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|So when|comes|(the) Command|(of) Allah,|it will be decided|in truth,|and will lose|there|the falsifiers.
Allah|(is) the One Who|made|for you|the cattle,|that you may ride|some of them|and some of them|you eat.
And for you|in them|(are) benefits|and that you may reach|through them|a need|(that is) in|your breasts;|and upon them|and upon|the ships|you are carried.
And He shows you|His Signs.|Then which|(of the) Signs|(of) Allah|will you deny?
Do they not|travel|through|the land|and see|how|was|(the) end|(of) those who|(were) before them?||They were|more numerous|than them|and mightier|(in) strength|and impressions|in|the land,|but not|availed|them|what|they used to|earn.
Then when|came to them|their Messengers|with clear proofs|they rejoiced|in what|they had|of|the knowledge,|and enveloped|them|what|they used to|[at it]|mock.
So when|they saw|Our punishment|they said,|"We believe|in Allah|Alone|and we disbelieve|in what|we used to|with Him|associate."
But did not||benefit them|their faith|when|they saw|Our punishment.|(Such is the) Way|(of) Allah|which|(has) indeed|preceded|among|His slaves.|And are lost|there|the disbelievers.
Ha Meem.
A revelation|from|the Most Gracious,|the Most Merciful,
A Book,|are detailed|its Verses,|a Quran|(in) Arabic|for a people|(who) know,
A giver of glad tidings|and a warner;|but turn away|most of them,|so they|(do) not|hear.
And they say,|"Our hearts|(are) in|coverings|from what|you call us|to it,|and in|our ears|(is) deafness,|and between us||and between you|(is) a screen.|So work,|indeed, we|(are) working."
Say,|"Only|I am|a man|like you,|it is revealed|to me|that|your god|(is) God|One;|so take a Straight Path|to Him|and ask His forgiveness."|And woe|to the polytheists,
Those who|(do) not|give|the zakah,|and they|in the Hereafter|they|(are) disbelievers.
Indeed,|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds,|for them|is a reward|never ending.|
Say,|"Do you indeed|[surely] disbelieve|in the One Who|created|the earth|in|two periods|and you set up|with Him|rivals?|That|(is the) Lord|(of) the worlds."
And He placed|therein|firmly-set mountains|above it||and He blessed|therein,|and determined|therein|its sustenance|in|four|periods|equal,|for those who ask.
Then|He directed (Himself)|towards|the heaven|while it (was)|smoke,|and He said|to it|and to the earth,|"Come both of you|willingly|or|unwillingly."|They both said,|"We come|willingly."
Then He completed them|(as) seven|heavens|in|two periods|and He revealed|in|each|heaven|its affair.|And We adorned|the heaven,|[the world],|with lamps|and (to) guard.|That|(is the) Decree|(of) the All-Mighty,|the All-Knower.
But if|they turn away,|then say,|"I have warned you|(of) a thunderbolt|like|(the) thunderbolt|(of) Aad|and Thamud.
When|came to them|the Messengers|from before them|||and from|behind them,|(saying) "Do not|worship|except|Allah."|They said,|"If|(had) willed|our Lord,|surely, He (would have) sent down|Angels.|So indeed, we|in what|you have been sent|with|(are) disbelievers."
Then as for|Aad,|they were arrogant|in|the land|without|[the] right|and they said,|"Who|(is) mightier|than us|(in) strength?"|Do not|they see|that|Allah,|the One Who|created them,|He|(is) Mightier|than them|(in) strength?|But they used to,|in Our Signs,|deny.
So We sent|upon them|a wind|furious|in|(the) days|(of) misfortune,|that We may make them taste|(the) punishment|(of) disgrace|in|the life|(of) the world.|And surely, (the) punishment|(of) the Hereafter|(is) more disgracing,|and they|will not be helped.|
And as for|Thamud,|We guided them,|but they preferred|[the] blindness|over|the guidance,|so seized them|a thunderbolt|(of) the punishment|humiliating,|for what|they used to|earn.
And We saved|those who|believed|and used to|fear (Allah).
And (the) Day|will be gathered|(the) enemies|(of) Allah|to|the Fire,|then they|will be assembled in rows,
Until,|when||they come to it|(will) testify|against them|their hearing,|and their sight,|and their skins,|(as) to what|they used to|do.
And they will say|to their skins,|"Why do|you testify|against us?"|They will say,|"Allah made us speak,||the One Who|makes speak|every|thing;|and He|created you|(the) first|time,|and to Him|you will be returned."
And not|you were|covering yourselves|lest|testify|against you|your hearing|and not|your sight|and not|your skins,|but|you assumed|that|Allah|(does) not|know|much|of what|you do.
And that|(was) your assumption|which|you assumed|about your Lord.|It has ruined you,|and you have become|of|the losers.
Then if|they endure,|the Fire|(is) an abode|for them;|and if|they ask for favor,|then not|they|(will be) of|those who receive favor.
And We have destined|for them|companions|(who) made fair-seeming|to them,|what|(was) before them||and what|(was) behind them,|and (is) justified|against them|the Word|among|nations|(that have) passed away||before them||of|the jinn|and the men.|Indeed, they|were|losers.
And said|those who|disbelieve,|"(Do) not|listen|to this|Quran,|and make noise|therein,|so that you may|overcome."
But surely We will cause to taste|those who|disbelieve|a punishment|severe,|and surely We will recompense them|(the) worst|(of) what|they used to|do.
That|(is the) recompense|(of the) enemies|(of) Allah -|the Fire;|for them|therein|(is the) home|(of) the eternity|(as) recompense|for what|they used to,|of Our Verses,|reject.
And (will) say|those who|disbelieve,|"Our Lord |Show us|those who|misled us|of|the jinn|and the men,|(so) we may put them|under|our feet,|that they be|of|the lowest."
Indeed,|those who|say,|"Our Lord,|(is) Allah,"|then|stand firm -|will descend|on them|the Angels,|"(Do) not|fear,|and (do) not|grieve|but receive the glad tidings|of Paradise|which|you were|promised.
We|(are) your protectors|in|the life|(of) the world|and in|the Hereafter.|And for you|therein|whatever|desire|your souls,|and for you|therein|what|you ask,
A hospitable gift|from|(the) Oft-Forgiving,|(the) Most Merciful."
And who|(is) better|(in) speech|than (one) who|invites|to|Allah|and does|righteous (deeds)|and says,|"Indeed, I am|of|those who submit?"
And not|(are) equal|the good (deed)|and|the evil (deed).|Repel|by (that) which|[it]|(is) better;|then behold |One who,|between you|and between him,|(was) enmity,|(will become) as if he|(was) a friend|intimate.
And not|it is granted|except|(to) those who|(are) patient|and not|it is granted|except|(to the) owner|(of) fortune|great.
And if|whisper comes to you|from|the Shaitaan,|an evil suggestion,|then seek refuge|in Allah.|Indeed, He|[He]|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Knower.
And of|His Signs|(are) the night|and the day|and the sun|and the moon.|(Do) not|prostrate|to the sun|and not|to the moon,|but prostrate|to Allah|the One Who|created them,|if|you,|Him alone,|worship.
But if|they are arrogant,|then those who|(are) near|your Lord,|glorify|Him|by night|and day.|And they|(do) not|tire.
And among|His Signs|(is) that you|see|the earth|barren,|but when|We send down|upon it|water|it is stirred (to life)|and grows.|Indeed,|the One Who|gives it life,|(is) surely the Giver of life|(to) the dead.|Indeed, He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
Indeed,|those who|distort|[in]|Our Verses|(are) not|hidden|from Us.|So, is (he) who|is cast|in|the Fire|better|or|(he) who|comes|secure|(on the) Day|(of) Resurrection?|Do|what|you will.|Indeed, He|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|in the Reminder|when|it comes to them.|And indeed, it|(is) surely a Book|mighty.
Not|comes to it|the falsehood|from|before it||and not|from|behind it.|A Revelation|from|(the) All-Wise,|(the) Praiseworthy.
Not|is said|to you|except|what|was said||to the Messengers|before you.||Indeed,|your Lord|(is) Possessor|(of) forgiveness,|and Possessor|(of) penalty|painful.
And if|We (had) made it|a Quran|(in) a foreign (language),|they (would have) said,|"Why not|are explained in detail|its verses?|(Is it) a foreign (language)|and an Arab?"|Say,|"It (is)|for those who|believe,|a guidance|and a healing."|And those who|(do) not|believe,|in|their ears|(is) deafness,|and it|(is) for them|blindness.|Those|are being called|from|a place|far."
And certainly,|We gave|Musa|the Book,|but disputes arose|therein.|And had it not been|(for) a word|that preceded|from|your Lord,|surely, would have been settled|between them.|But indeed, they|surely (are) in|doubt|about it|disquieting.
Whoever|does|righteous deeds|then it is for his soul;|and whoever|does evil,|then it is against it.|And not|(is) your Lord|unjust|to His slaves.
To Him|is referred|(the) knowledge|(of) the Hour.|And not|come out|any|fruits|from|their coverings,|and not|bears|any|female|and not|gives birth|except|with His knowledge.|And (the) Day|He will call them,|"Where (are)|My partners?"|They will say,|"We announce (to) You,|not|among us|any|witness."
And lost|from them|what|they were|invoking|before,||and they (will) be certain|(that) not|for them|any|place of escape.
(Does) not|get tired|man|of|praying|(for) the good,|but if|touches him|the evil|then he gives up hope|(and) despairs.
And verily, if|We let him taste|mercy|from Us|after||an adversity|(has) touched him,|he will surely say,|"This (is)|(due) to me|and not|I think|the Hour|(will be) established,|and if|I am returned|to|my Lord,|indeed,|for me|with Him|(will be) the best."|But We will surely inform|those who|disbelieved|about what|they did,|and We will surely make them taste|of|a punishment|severe.
And when|We bestow favor|upon|man,|he turns away -|and distances himself;||but when|touches him|the evil,|then (he is) full|(of) supplication|lengthy.
Say,|"You see -|if|it is|from||Allah|then|you disbelieve|in it,|who|(is) more astray|than (one) who -|he|(is) in|opposition|far?"
Soon We will show them|Our Signs|in|the horizons|and in|themselves|until|becomes clear|to them,|that it|(is) the truth.|Is (it) not|sufficient|concerning your Lord,|that He|(is) over|all|things|a Witness?
Unquestionably,|they|(are) in|doubt|about|(the) meeting|(with) their Lord?|Unquestionably,|indeed, He|(is) of all|things|encompassing.
Ha Meem.
Ayn Seen Qaaf.
Thus|reveals|to you,|and to|those|before you -||Allah|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
To Him|(belong) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth,|and He|(is) the Most High,|the Most Great.
Almost|the heavens|break up|from|above them,|and the Angels|glorify|(the) praise|(of) their Lord|and ask for forgiveness|for those|on|the earth.|Unquestionably,|indeed,|Allah,|He|(is) the Oft-Forgiving,|the Most Merciful.
And those who|take|besides Him||protectors,|Allah|(is) a Guardian|over them,|and not|you|(are) over them|a manager.
And thus|We have revealed|to you|a Quran|(in) Arabic,|that you may warn|(the) mother|(of) the towns,|and whoever|(is) around it,|and warn|(of the) Day|(of) Assembly,|(there is) no|doubt|in it.|A party|(will be) in|Paradise|and a party|in|the Blazing Fire.
And if|Allah willed,||He could have made them|a community|one,|but|He admits|whom|He wills|in (to)|His Mercy.|And the wrongdoers,|not|for them|any|protector|and not|any helper.
Or|have they taken|besides Him||protectors?|But Allah -|He|(is) the Protector,|and He|gives life|(to) the dead.|And He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And whatever|you differ|in it|of|a thing,|then its ruling|(is) to|Allah.|That|(is) Allah,|my Lord,|upon Him|I put my trust|and to Him|I turn.
(The) Creator|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|He made|for you|from|yourselves,|mates,|and among|the cattle|mates;|He multiplies you|thereby.|(There) is not|like Him|anything,|and He|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Seer.
To Him (belongs)|(the) keys|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|He extends|the provision|for whom|He wills|and restricts.|Indeed, He|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
He has ordained|for you|of|the religion|what|He enjoined|upon|Nuh,|and that which|We have revealed|to you,|and what|We enjoined|upon|Ibrahim|and Musa|and Isa.|To|establish|the religion|and not|be divided|therein.|Is difficult|on|the polytheists|what|you call them|to it.|Allah|chooses|for Himself|whom|He wills,|and guides|to Himself|whoever|turns.
And not|they became divided|until|after||[what]|came to them|the knowledge|(out of) rivalry,|among them.|And if not|(for) a word|(that) preceded|from|your Lord|for|a term|specified,|surely, it (would have) been settled|between them.|And indeed,|those who|were made to inherit|the Book|after them||(are) surely in|doubt|concerning it -|disquieting.
So to that|then invite,|and stand firm|as|you are commanded|and (do) not|follow|their desires,|but say,|"I believe|in what|Allah has sent down||of|(the) Book,|and I am commanded|that I do justice|between you.|Allah|(is) our Lord|and your Lord.|For us|our deeds|and for you|your deeds.|(There is) no|argument|between us|and between you.|Allah|will assemble|[between] us,|and to Him|(is) the final return."
And those who|argue|concerning|Allah|after||[what]|response has been made to Him,||their argument|(is) invalid|with|their Lord,|and upon them|(is) wrath,|and for them|(is) a punishment|severe.
Allah|(is) the One Who|(has) sent down|the Book|in truth,|and the Balance.|And what|will make you know?|Perhaps|the Hour|(is) near.
Seek to hasten|[of] it|those who|(do) not|believe|in it,|and those who|believe|(are) fearful|of it|and know|that it|(is) the truth.|Unquestionably,|indeed,|those who|dispute|concerning|the Hour|(are) certainly in|error|far.
Allah|(is) Subtle|with His slaves;|He gives provision|(to) whom|He wills.|And He|(is) the All-Strong,|the All-Mighty.
Whoever|is|desiring|(the) harvest|(of) the Hereafter -|We increase|for him|in|his harvest.|And whoever|is|desiring|(the) harvest|(of) the world,|We give him|of it,|but not|for him|in|the Hereafter|any|share.
Or|for them|(are) partners|who have ordained|for them|of|the religion|what|not|Allah has given permission of it|||And if not|(for) a word|decisive,|surely, it (would have) been judged|between them.|And indeed,|the wrongdoers,|for them|(is a) punishment|painful.
You will see|the wrongdoers|fearful|of what|they earned,|and it|(will) befall|[on] them.|And those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|(will be) in|flowering meadows|(of) the Gardens,|for them|(is) whatever|they wish|with|their Lord.|That -|it|(is) the Bounty|the Great.
That|(is of) which|Allah gives glad tidings||(to) His slaves -|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds.|Say,|"Not|I ask you|for it|any payment|except|the love|among|the relatives."|And whoever|earns|any good,|We increase|for him|therein|good.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|All-Appreciative.
Or|(do) they say,|"He has invented|about|Allah|a lie?"|But if|Allah willed||He would seal|[over]|your heart.|And Allah eliminates||the falsehood|and establishes|the truth|by His Words.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Knowing|of what|(is in) the breasts.
And He|(is) the One Who|accepts|the repentance|of|His slaves|and pardons|[of]|the evil,|and He knows|what|you do.
And He answers|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|and increases (for) them|from|His Bounty.|And the disbelievers -|for them|(will be) a punishment|severe.
And if|Allah extends||the provision|for His slaves,|surely they would rebel|in|the earth;|but|He sends down|in (due) measure|what|He wills.|Indeed, He|of His slaves|(is) All-Aware,|All-Seer.
And He|(is) the One Who|sends down|the rain|after||[what]|they have despaired,|and spreads|His mercy.|And He|(is) the Protector,|the Praiseworthy.
And among|His Signs|(is the) creation|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|He has dispersed|in both of them|of|(the) creatures.|And He|(is) over|their gathering,|when|He wills,|All-Powerful.
And whatever|befalls you|of|(the) misfortune,|(is because) of what|have earned|your hands.|But He pardons|[from]|much.
And not|you|(can) escape|in|the earth,|and not|for you|besides||Allah|any|protector|and not|any helper.
And among|His Signs|(are) the ships|in|the sea,|like [the] mountains.
If|He wills,|He can cause the wind to become still||then they would remain|motionless|on|its back.|Indeed,|in|that|surely (are) Signs|for everyone|patient|(and) grateful.
Or|He could destroy them|for what|they have earned;|but He pardons|[from]|much.
And may know|those who|dispute|concerning|Our Signs|(that) not|for them|any|place of refuge.
So whatever|you are given|of|a thing,|(is) but a passing enjoyment|(for) the life|(of) the world.|But what|(is) with|Allah|(is) better|and more lasting|for those who|believe|and upon|their Lord|put (their) trust.
And those who|avoid|(the) greater|sins|and the immoralities,|and when||they are angry,|they|forgive,
And those who|respond|to their Lord|and establish|prayer|and their affairs|(are conducted by) consultation|among them,|and from what|We have provided them|they spend,
And those who,|when|strikes them|tyranny,|they|defend themselves.
(The) recompense|(of) an evil|(is) an evil|like it.|But whoever|pardons|and makes reconciliation,|then his reward|(is) on|Allah.|Indeed, He|(does) not|like|the wrongdoers.
And surely whosoever|defends himself|after|he has been wronged,|then those|not|(is) against them|any|way.
Only|the way|against|those who|oppress|the people|and rebel|in|the earth|without|right.|Those|for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
And whoever|(is) patient|and forgives,|indeed,|that|(is) surely of|matters of determination.|
And whoever|Allah lets go astray||then not|for him|any|protector|after Him.||And you will see|the wrongdoers,|when|they see|the punishment|saying,|"Is|(there) for|return|any|way?"
And you will see them|being exposed|to it,|humbled|by|disgrace,|looking|with|a glance|stealthy.|And will say|those who|believed,|"Indeed,|the losers|(are) those who|lost|themselves|and their families|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|Unquestionably |Indeed,|the wrongdoers|(are) in|a punishment|lasting.
And not|will be|for them|any|protector|(who) will help them|besides||Allah.|And whom|Allah lets go astray||then not|for him|any|way.
Respond|to your Lord|before||[that]|comes|a Day|(there is) no|averting|for it|from|Allah.|Not|(is) for you|any|refuge|(on) that Day|and not|for you|any|denial.
Then if|they turn away,|then not|We have sent you|over them|(as) a guardian.|Not|(is) on you|except|the conveyance.|And indeed,|when|We cause to taste|[the] man|from Us|Mercy,|he rejoices|in it.|But if|befalls them|evil,|for what|have sent forth|their hands|then indeed,|[the] man|(is) ungrateful.
To Allah|(belongs the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|He creates|what|He wills.|He grants|to whom|He wills|females,|and He grants|to whom|He wills|[the] males.
Or|He grants them|males|and females;|and He makes|whom|He wills|barren.|Indeed, He|(is) All-Knower,|All-Powerful.
And not|is|for any human|that|Allah should speak to him||except|(by) revelation|or|from|behind|a veil|or|(by) sending|a messenger|then he reveals|by His permission|what|He wills.|Indeed, He|(is) Most High,|Most Wise.
And thus|We have revealed|to you|an inspiration|by|Our Command.|Not|(did) you|know|what|the Book (is)|and not|the faith.|But|We have made it|a light,|We guide|with it|whom|We will|of|Our slaves.|And indeed, you|surely guide|to|(the) Path|Straight,
(The) path|(of) Allah,|the One|to Whom|(belongs) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|Unquestionably |To|Allah|reach all affairs.|
Ha Meem.
By the Book|the clear,
Indeed, We|(have) made it|a Quran|(in) Arabic|so that you may|understand.
And indeed, it|(is) in|(the) Mother|(of) the Book|with Us,|surely exalted,|full of wisdom.
Then should We take away|from you|the Reminder,|disregarding (you),|because|you are|a people|transgressing?
And how many|We sent|a Prophet||among|the former (people),
And not|came to them|any Prophet||but|they used to|mock at him.|
Then We destroyed|stronger|than them|(in) power|and has passed|(the) example|(of) the former (people).
And if|you ask them,|"Who|created|the heavens|and the earth?"|They will surely say,|"Created them|the All-Mighty,|the All-Knower,"
The One Who|made|for you|the earth|a bed,|and made|for you|therein|roads|so that you may|(be) guided,
And the One Who|sends down|from|the sky|water|in (due) measure,|then We revive|with it|a land|dead,|thus|you will be brought forth,
And the One Who|created|the pairs|all of them|and made|for you|[of]|the ships|and the cattle|what|you ride,
That you may sit firmly,|on|their backs,|then|remember|(the) favor|(of) your Lord|when|you sit firmly|on them|and say,|"Glory be (to)|the One Who|(has) subjected|to us|this,|and not|we were|of it|capable.
And indeed, we|to|our Lord,|will surely return."
But they attribute|to Him|from|His slaves|a portion.|Indeed,|man|surely (is) clearly ungrateful.|
Or|has He taken|of what,|He has created,|daughters|and He has chosen (for) you|sons.
And when|is given good news,|(to) one of them,|of what|he sets up|for the Most Gracious|(as) a likeness,|becomes|his face|dark|and he|(is) filled with grief.
Then (is one) who|is brought up|in|ornaments|and he|in|the dispute|(is) not|clear.
And they made,|the Angels,|those who|themselves|(are) slaves|(of) the Most Gracious,|females.|Did they witness|their creation?|Will be recorded|their testimony,|and they will be questioned.
And they say,|"If|had willed|the Most Gracious,|we would not have worshipped them."||Not|they have|about that|any|knowledge.|Nothing|they (do)|but|lie.
Or|have We given them|a book|before it,||so they|to it|(are) holding fast?
Nay,|they say,|"Indeed, we|[we] found|our forefathers|upon|a religion|and indeed, we|on|their footsteps|(are) guided."
And thus|not|We sent|before you||in|a town|any|warner|except|said|(the) wealthy ones of it,|"Indeed, we|[we] found|our forefathers|on|a religion,|and indeed, we|[on]|their footsteps|(are) following."
He said,|"Even if|I brought you|better guidance|than what|you found|on it|your forefathers?"|They said,|"Indeed, we|with what|you are sent|with [it]|(are) disbelievers."
So We took retribution|from them.|Then see|how|was|(the) end|(of) the deniers.
And when|Ibrahim said||to his father|and his people,|"Indeed, I (am)|disassociated|from what|you worship
Except|the One Who|created me;|and indeed, He|will guide me."
And he made it|a word|lasting|among|his descendents,|so that they may|return.
Nay,|I gave enjoyment|(to) these|and their forefathers|until|came to them|the truth|and a Messenger|clear.
And when|came to them|the truth,|they said,|"This|(is) magic,|and indeed, we|of it|(are) disbelievers."
And they say,|"Why not|was sent down|this|the Quran|to|a man,|from|the two towns,|great?"
Do they|distribute|(the) Mercy|(of) your Lord?|We|[We] distribute|among them|their livelihood|in|the life|(of) the world,|and We raise|some of them|above|others|(in) degrees|so that may take,|some of them,|others,|(for) service.|But (the) Mercy|(of) your Lord|(is) better|than what|they accumulate.
And if not|that|(would) become|[the] mankind|a community|one,|We (would have) made|for (one) who|disbelieves|in the Most Gracious|for their houses|roofs|of|silver|and stairways|upon which|they mount
And for their houses|doors|and couches|upon which|they recline
And ornaments of gold.|And not (is)|all|that|but|an enjoyment|(of) the life|(of) the world.|And the Hereafter|with|your Lord|(is) for the righteous.
And whoever|turns away|from|(the) remembrance|(of) the Most Gracious,|We appoint|for him|a devil,|then he|(is) to him|a companion.
And indeed, they|surely, turn them away|from|the Path|and they think|that they|(are) guided.
Until|when|he comes to Us|he says,|"O would that|between me|and between you|(were the) distance|(of) the East and the West."|How wretched is|the companion 
And never|will benefit you|the Day,|when|you have wronged,|that you|(will be) in|the punishment|sharing.
Then can you|cause to hear|the deaf|or|guide|the blind|and (one) who|is|in|an error|clear?
And whether|We take you away,||then indeed, We,|from them|(will) take retribution.
Or|We show you|that which|We have promised them,|then indeed, We|over them|have full power.
So hold fast|to that which|is revealed|to you.|Indeed, you|(are) on|a Path|Straight.
And indeed, it|(is) surely, a Reminder|for you|and your people,|and soon|you will be questioned.
And ask|(those) whom|We sent|before you||of|Our Messengers;|did We make|besides||the Most Gracious|gods|to be worshipped?
And certainly|We sent|Musa|with Our Signs|to|Firaun|and his chiefs,|and he said,|"Indeed, I am|a Messenger|(of the) Lord|(of) the worlds."
But when|he came to them|with Our Signs,|behold |They|at them|laughed.
And not|We showed them|of|a Sign|but|it|(was) greater|than|its sister,|and We seized them|with the punishment|so that they may|return.
And they said,|"O|[the] magician |Invoke|for us|your Lord|by what|He has made covenant|with you.|Indeed, we|(will) surely be guided."
But when|We removed|from them|the punishment|behold |They|broke (their word).
And called out|Firaun|among|his people;|he said,|"O my people |Is not|for me|(the) kingdom|(of) Egypt|and these|[the] rivers|flowing|underneath me?||Then do not|you see?
Or|am I|better|than|this,|one who -|he|(is) insignificant|and hardly||clear?
Then why not|are placed|on him|bracelets|of|gold|or|come|with him|the Angels|accompanying (him)?"
So he bluffed|his people,|and they obeyed him.|Indeed, they|were|a people|defiantly disobedient.
So when|they angered Us,|We took retribution|from them,|and We drowned them|all.
And We made them|a precedent|and an example|for the later (generations).
And when|is presented,|(the) son|(of) Maryam,|(as) an example|behold |Your people|about it|laughed aloud.
And they said,|"Are our gods|better|or|he?"|Not|they present it|to you|except|(for) argument.|Nay,|they|(are) a people|argumentative.
Not|he|(was) except|a slave,|We bestowed Our favor|on him|and We made him|an example|for (the) Children of Israel.|
And if|We willed,|surely We (could have) made|among you|Angels|in|the earth|succeeding.
And indeed, it|surely (is) a knowledge|of the Hour.|So (do) not|(be) doubtful|about it,|and follow Me.|This|(is the) Path|Straight.
And (let) not|avert you|the Shaitaan.|Indeed, he|(is) for you|an enemy|clear.
And when|came|Isa|with clear proofs,|he said,|"Verily,|I have come to you|with wisdom|and that I make clear|to you|some|(of) that which|you differ|in it.|So fear|Allah|and obey me.
Indeed,|Allah,|He|(is) my Lord|and your Lord,|so worship Him.|This|(is) a Path|Straight."
But differed|the factions|from|among them,|so woe|to those who|wronged|from|(the) punishment|(of the) Day|painful.
Are|they waiting|except|(for) the Hour|that|it should come on them|suddenly|while they|(do) not|perceive?
Friends|that Day,|some of them|to others|(will be) enemies|except|the righteous,
"O My slaves |No|fear|on you|this Day|and not|you|will grieve,
Those who|believed|in Our Verses|and were|submissive.
Enter|Paradise,|you|and your spouses|delighted."
Will be circulated|for them|plates|of|gold|and cups.|And therein|(is) what|desires|the souls|and delights|the eyes,|and you|therein|will abide forever.
And this|(is) the Paradise|which|you are made to inherit|for what|you used (to)|do.
For you|therein|(are) fruits|abundant,|from it|you will eat.
Indeed,|the criminals|(will be) in|(the) punishment|(of) Hell|abiding forever.
Not|will it subside|for them,|and they|in it|(will) despair.
And not|We wronged them|but|they were|themselves|wrongdoers.
And they will call,|"O Malik |Let put an end|to us|your Lord."|He (will) say,|"Indeed, you|(will) remain."
Certainly,|We have brought you|the truth,|but|most of you,|to the truth|(are) averse.
Or|have they determined|an affair?|Then indeed, We|(are) determined.
Or|(do) they think|that We|(can) not|hear|their secret(s)|and their private counsel(s)?|Nay,|and Our messengers|with them,|are recording.
Say,|"If|had|the Most Gracious|a son.|Then, I|(would be the) first|(of) the worshippers."
Glory be|(to the) Lord,|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|(the) Lord|(of) the Throne,|above what|they ascribe.
So leave them|(to) converse vainly|and play|until|they meet|their Day|which|they are promised
And He|(is) the One Who|(is) in|the heaven -|God,|and in|the earth -|God.|And He|(is) the All-Wise,|the All-Knower.
And blessed (is)|the One Who -|to Whom|(belongs the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between both of them|and with Him|(is the) knowledge|(of) the Hour,|and to Him|you will be returned.
And not|have power|those whom|they invoke|besides Him||(for) the intercession;|except|who|testifies|to the truth,|and they|know.
And if|you ask them|who|created them,|they will certainly say,|"Allah."|Then how|are they deluded?
And his saying,|"O my Lord |Indeed,|these|(are) a people|(who do) not|believe."
So turn away|from them|and say,|"Peace."|But soon|they will know.
Ha Meem.
By the Book|the clear,
Indeed, We|revealed it|in|a Night|Blessed.|Indeed, We|[We] are|(ever) warning.
Therein|is made distinct|every|affair,|wise,
A command|from|Us.|Indeed, We|[We] are|(ever) sending,
As Mercy|from|your Lord.|Indeed, He|[He]|(is) the All-Hearer,|the All-Knower.
Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between both of them,|if|you are|certain.
(There is) no|god|except|Him;|He gives life|and causes death,|your Lord|and (the) Lord|(of) your fathers|the former.
Nay,|they|(are) in|doubt -|playing.
Then watch|(for the) Day|(when) will bring|the sky|smoke|visible,
Enveloping|the people.|This|(will be) a punishment|painful.
"Our Lord |Remove|from us|the punishment;|indeed, we|(are) believers."
How can|(there be) for them|the reminder,|when verily,|had come to them|a Messenger|clear.
Then|they turned away|from him|and said,|"One taught,|a mad man."
Indeed, We|(will) remove|the punishment|a little,|indeed, you|(will) return.
(The) Day|We will seize|(with) the seizure|the greatest,|indeed, We|(will) take retribution.
And certainly,|We tried|before them|(the) people|(of) Firaun,|and came to them|a Messenger|noble.
That,|"Deliver|to me|(the) servants|(of) Allah.|Indeed, I am|to you|a Messenger|trustworthy.
And that|(do) not|exalt yourselves|against|Allah.|Indeed, I|[I] have come to you|with an authority|clear.
And indeed, I|[I] seek refuge|with my Lord|and your Lord|lest|you stone me.
And if|not|you believe|me,|then leave me alone."
So he called|his Lord,|"That|these|(are) a people|criminals."
Then "Set out|with My slaves|(by) night.|Indeed, you|(will be) followed.
And leave|the sea|at rest.|Indeed, they|(are) an army|(to be) drowned."
How many|(did) they leave|of|gardens|and springs,
And cornfields|and places|noble,
And pleasant things|they used to|therein|take delight 
Thus.|And We made it (an) inherit(ance)|(for) a people|another.
And not|wept|for them|the heaven|and the earth|and not|they were|given respite.
And certainly,|We saved|(the) Children of Israel||from|the punishment|the humiliating,
From|Firaun.|Indeed, he|was|arrogant|among|the transgressors.
And certainly|We chose them|by|knowledge|over|the worlds.
And We gave them|of|the Signs|that|in it|(was) a trial|clear.
Indeed,|these|surely, they say,
"Not|it|(is) but|our death|the first|and not|we|(will be) raised again.
Then bring|our forefathers,|if|you are|truthful."
Are they|better|or|(the) people|(of) Tubba|and those|before them?||We destroyed them,|indeed, they|were|criminals.
And not|We created|the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between them|(in) play.
Not|We created both of them|but|in [the] truth,|but|most of them|(do) not|know.
Indeed,|(the) Day of Judgment||(is) an appointed term for them|all.
(The) Day|not|will avail|a relation|for|a relation|anything|and not|they|will be helped.
Except,|(on) whom|Allah has mercy.||Indeed, He|[He]|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Most Merciful.
Indeed,|(the) tree|(of) Zaqqum
(Will be) food|(of) the sinner(s).
Like the murky oil,|it will boil|in|the bellies,
Like boiling|(of) scalding water.
"Seize him|and drag him|into|(the) midst|(of) the Hellfire,
Then|pour|over|his head|of|(the) punishment|(of) the scalding water.
Taste |Indeed, you|[you] (were)|the mighty,|the noble.
Indeed,|this|(is) what|you used to|[about it]|doubt."
Indeed,|the righteous|(will be) in|a place|secure,
In|gardens|and springs,
Wearing garments|of|fine silk|and heavy silk,|facing each other.
Thus.|And We will marry them|(to) companions with beautiful eyes.|
They will call|therein|for every (kind)|(of) fruit,|secure.
Not|they will taste|therein|the death|except|the death|the first.|And He will protect them|(from the) punishment|(of) the Hellfire,
A Bounty|from|your Lord.|That -|it|(will be) the success|the great.
Indeed,|We have made it easy|in your tongue|so that they may|take heed.
So watch;|indeed, they|(too are) watching.
Ha Meem.
(The) revelation|(of) the Book|(is) from|Allah|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
Indeed,|in|the heavens|and the earth|surely (are) Signs|for the believers.
And in|your creation|and what|He disperses|of|(the) moving creatures|(are) Signs|for a people|who are certain.
And (in the) alternation|(of) the night|and the day|and what|Allah sends down||from|the sky|of|(the) provision|and gives life|thereby|(to) the earth|after|its death,|and (in) directing|(the) winds|(are) Signs|for a people|who reason.
These|(are the) Verses,|(of) Allah|We recite them|to you|in truth.|Then in what|statement|after|Allah|and His Verses|will they believe?
Woe|to every|liar|sinful
Who hears|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|recited|to him,|then|persists|arrogantly|as if|not|he heard them.|So give him tidings|(of) a punishment|painful.
And when|he knows|of|Our Verses,|anything,|he takes them|(in) ridicule.|Those -|for them|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
Before them||(is) Hell|and not|will avail|them|what|they had earned|anything,|and not|what|they had taken|besides||Allah|(as) protectors.|And for them|(is) a punishment|great.
This|(is) guidance.|And those who|disbelieve|in (the) Verses|(of) their Lord,|for them|(is) a punishment|of|filth,|painful.
Allah|(is) the One Who|subjected|to you|the sea|that may sail|the ships|therein|by His Command,|and that you may seek|of|His Bounty|and that you may|give thanks.
And He has subjected|to you|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth -|all|from Him.|Indeed,|in|that|surely are Signs|for a people|who give thought.
Say|to those who|believe|(to) forgive|those who|(do) not|hope|(for the) days|(of) Allah;|that He may recompense|a people|for what|they used to|earn.
Whoever|does|a righteous deed,|then it is for his soul,|and whoever|does evil,|then it (is) against it.|Then|to|your Lord|you will be returned.
And certainly,|We gave|(the) Children of Israel||the Book|and the wisdom|and the Prophethood,|and We provided them|of|the good things|and We preferred them|over|the worlds.
And We gave them|clear proofs|of|the matter.|And not|they differed|except|after||[what]|came to them|the knowledge,|(out of) envy|between themselves.|Indeed,|your Lord|will judge|between them|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection|about what|they used to|therein|differ.
Then|We put you|on|an ordained way|of|the matter;|so follow it|and (do) not|follow|(the) desires|(of) those who|(do) not|know.
Indeed, they|never|will avail|you|against|Allah|(in) anything.|And indeed,|the wrongdoers|some of them|(are) allies|(of) others,|and Allah|(is the) Protector|(of) the righteous.
This|(is) enlightenment|for mankind|and guidance|and mercy|for a people|who are certain.
Do|think|those who|commit|evil deeds|that|We will make them|like those who|believed|and did|righteous deeds|equal|(in) their life|and their death?|Evil is|what|they judge 
And Allah created||the heavens|and the earth|in truth|and that may be recompensed|every|soul|for what|it has earned,|and they|will not be wronged.|
Have you seen|(he) who|takes|(as) his god|his desire|and Allah lets him go astray||knowingly,||and He sets a seal|upon|his hearing|and his heart|and puts|over|his vision|a veil?|Then who|will guide him|after||Allah?|Then will not|you receive admonition?
And they say,|"Not|it|(is) but|our life|(of) the world,|we die|and we live,|and not|destroys us|except|the time."|And not|for them|of that|any|knowledge;|not,|they|(do) but|guess.
And when|are recited|to them|Our Verses|clear,|not|is|their argument|except|that|they say,|"Bring|our forefathers|if|you are|truthful."
Say,|"Allah|gives you life,|then|causes you to die;|then|He will gather you|to|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection,|no|doubt|about it."|But|most|(of) the people|(do) not|know.
And for Allah|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth;|and (the) Day|is established|the Hour,|that Day|will lose|the falsifiers.
And you will see|every|nation|kneeling.|Every|nation|will be called|to|its record,|"Today|you will be recompensed|(for) what|you used to|do.
This,|Our Record,|speaks|about you|in truth.|Indeed, We|[We] used to|transcribe|what|you used to|do."
Then as for|those who|believed|and did|[the] righteous deeds,|will admit them|their Lord|in(to)|His mercy.|That|[it]|(is) the success|clear.
But as for|those who|disbelieved,|"Then were not||My Verses|recited|to you|but you were proud|and you became|a people|criminals?"
And when|it was said,|"Indeed|(the) Promise|(of) Allah|(is) true|and the Hour -|(there is) no|doubt|about it,|you said,|'Not|we know|what|the Hour (is).|Not|we think|except|an assumption,|and not|we|(are) convinced.'"
And (will) appear|to them|(the) evil|(of) what|they did|and (will) envelop|them|what|they used|[at it]|(to) mock.
And it will be said,|"Today|We forget you|as|you forgot|(the) meeting|(of) this Day of yours,||and your abode|(is) the Fire,|and not|for you|any|helpers.
That|(is) because you|took|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|(in) ridicule|and deceived you|the life|(of) the world."|So this Day|not|they will be brought forth|from it|and not|they|will be asked to appease.
Then for Allah|(is) all the praise,|(the) Lord|(of) the heavens|and (the) Lord|(of) the earth,|(the) lord|(of) the worlds.
And for Him|(is) the greatness|in|the heavens|and the earth,|and He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
Ha Meem.
(The) revelation|(of) the Book|(is) from|Allah|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise
Not|We created|the heavens|and the earth|and what|(is) between both of them|except|in truth|and (for) a term|appointed.|But those who|disbelieve,|from what|they are warned,|(are) turning away.
Say,|"Do you see|what|you call|besides||Allah?|Show me|what|they have created|of|the earth|or|for them|(is) any share|in|the heavens?|Bring me|a book||before|this|or|traces|of|knowledge,|if|you are|truthful."
And who|(is) more astray|than (he) who|calls|besides||Allah,|who|will not respond||to him|until|(the) Day|(of) Resurrection,|and they|of|their calls|(are) unaware.
And when|are gathered|the people,|they will be|for them|enemies|and they will be|of their worship|deniers.
And when|are recited|to them|Our Verses|clear,|say|those who|disbelieve|of the truth|when|it comes to them,|"This|(is) a magic|clear."
Or|they say,|"He has invented it."|Say,|"If|I have invented it|then not|you have power|for me|against|Allah|anything.|He|knows best|of what|you utter|concerning it.|Sufficient is He||(as) a Witness|between me|and between you,|and He|(is) the Oft-Forgiving,|the Most Merciful.
Say,|"Not|I am|a new (one)|among|the Messengers|and not|I know|what|will be done|with me|and not|with you.|Not|I follow|but|what|is revealed|to me|and not|I am|but|a warner|clear."
Say,|"Do you see|if|it is|from Allah|||and you disbelieve|in it,|and testifies|a witness|from|(the) Children of Israel||to|(the) like thereof,|then he believed|while you are arrogant?"|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|the people|the wrongdoers.
And say|those who|disbelieve|of those who|believe,|"If|it had been|good,|not|they (would) have preceded us|to it."|And when|not|they (are) guided|by it,|they say,|"This|(is) a lie|ancient."
And before it||(was the) Scripture|(of) Musa|(as) a guide|and a mercy.|And this|(is) a Book|confirming,|(in) language|Arabic|to warn|those who|do wrong|and glad tidings|for the good-doers.
Indeed,|those who|say,|"Our Lord|(is) Allah,"|then|remain firm,|then no|fear|on them|and not|they|will grieve.
Those|(are the) companions|(of) Paradise|abiding forever|therein,|a reward|for what|they used to|do.
And We have enjoined|(on) man|to his parents|kindness.|Carried him|his mother|(with) hardship|and gave birth to him|(with) hardship.|And (the) bearing of him|and (the) weaning of him|(is) thirty|month(s)|until,|when|he reaches|his maturity|and reaches|forty|year(s),|he says,|"My Lord,|grant me (the) power|that|I may be grateful|(for) Your favor|which|You have bestowed|upon me|and upon|my parents|and that|I do|righteous (deeds)|which please You,|and make righteous|for me|among|my offspring,|indeed,|I turn|to You|and indeed, I am|of|those who submit."
Those|(are) the ones|We will accept|from them|(the) best|(of) what|they did|and We will overlook|[from]|their evil deeds,|among|(the) companions|(of) Paradise.|A promise|true|which|they were|promised.
But the one who|says|to his parents,|"Uff|to both of you |Do you promise me|that|I will be brought forth,|and have already passed away||the generations|before me?"||And they both|seek help|(of) Allah.|"Woe to you |Believe |Indeed,|(the) Promise|(of) Allah|(is) true."|But he says,|"Not|(is) this|but|(the) stories|(of) the former (people)."
Those -|(are) the ones|(has) proved true|against them|the word|among|nations|(that) already passed away||before them||of|(the) jinn|and the men.|Indeed, they|are|(the) losers.
And for all|(are) degrees|for what|they did,|and that He may fully compensate them|(for) their deeds,|and they|will not be wronged.|
And (the) Day|will be exposed|those who|disbelieved|to|the Fire.|"You exhausted|your good things|in|your life|(of) the world,|and you took your pleasures|therein.|So today|you will be recompensed|(with) a punishment|humiliating|because|you were|arrogant|in|the earth|without|[the] right|and because|you were|defiantly disobedient."
And mention|(the) brother|(of) Aad,|when|he warned|his people|in the Al-Ahqaf -|and had already passed away||[the] warners|before him|||and after him,||"That not|you worship|except|Allah.|Indeed, I|[I] fear|for you|a punishment|(of) a Day|Great."
They said,|"Have you come to us|to turn us away|from|our gods?|Then bring us|what|you threaten us,|if|you are|of|the truthful."
He said,|"Only|the knowledge|(is) with Allah||and I convey to you|what|I am sent|with it,|but|I see you|a people|ignorant."
Then when|they saw it|(as) a cloud|approaching|their valleys,|they said,|"This|(is) a cloud|bringing us rain."|Nay,|it|(is) what|you were asking it to be hastened,||a wind|in it|(is) a punishment|painful,
Destroying|every|thing|by (the) command|(of) its Lord.|Then they became (such),|not|is seen|except|their dwellings.|Thus|We recompense|the people|[the] criminals.
And certainly,|We had established them|in what|not|We have established you|in it,|and We made|for them|hearing|and vision|and hearts.|But not|availed|them|their hearing|and not|their vision|and not|their hearts|any|thing,|when|they were|rejecting|(the) Signs|(of) Allah|and enveloped|them|what|they used to|[at it]|ridicule.
And certainly|We destroyed|what|surrounds you|of|the towns,|and We have diversified|the Signs,|that they may|return.
Then why (did) not|help them|those whom|they had taken|besides||Allah|gods as a way of approach?||Nay,|they were lost|from them.|And that|(was) their falsehood|and what|they were|inventing.
And when|We directed|to you|a party|of|the jinn,|listening|(to) the Quran.|And when|they attended it,|they said,|"Listen quietly."|And when|it was concluded,|they turned back|to|their people|(as) warners.
They said,|"O our people |Indeed, we|[we] have heard|a Book|revealed|after||Musa|confirming|what|(was) before it,||guiding|to|the truth|and to|a Path|Straight.
O our people |Respond|(to the) caller|(of) Allah|and believe|in him.|He will forgive|for you|of|your sins|and will protect you|from|a punishment|painful.
And whoever|(does) not|respond|(to the) caller|(of) Allah,|then not|he can escape|in|the earth,|and not|for him|besides Him||protectors.|Those|(are) in|error|clear."
Do not|they see|that|Allah,|(is) the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|and (was) not|tired|by their creation,|(is) able|to give life|||(to) the dead?|Yes,|indeed He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
And (the) Day,|are exposed|those who|disbelieved|to|the Fire,|"Is not|this|the truth?"|They will say,|"Yes|by our Lord."|He will say,|"Then taste|the punishment|because|you used to|disbelieve."
So be patient,|as|had patience|those of determination||of|the Messengers,|and (do) not|seek to hasten|for them.|As if they had,|(the) Day|they see|what|they were promised,|not|remained|except|an hour|of|a day.|A Notification.|But will|(any) be destroyed|except|the people -|the defiantly disobedient?
Those who|disbelieve|and turn away|from|(the) way of Allah,||He will cause to be lost|their deeds.
And those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds,|and believe|in what|is revealed|to|Muhammad,|and it|(is) the truth|from|their Lord,|He will remove|from them|their misdeeds,|and improve|their condition.
That|(is) because|those who|disbelieve|follow|falsehood|and that|those who|believe|follow|(the) truth|from|their Lord.|Thus|Allah presents||to the people|their similitudes.
So when|you meet|those who|disbelieve,|then strike|the necks|until|when|you have subdued them,|then bind firmly|the bond,|then either|a favor|afterwards|or|ransom|until|lays down|the war|its burdens.|That.|And if|Allah had willed||surely, He could have taken retribution|from them,|but|to test|some of you|with others.|And those who|are killed|in|(the) way of Allah,||then never|He will cause to be lost|their deeds.
He will guide them|and improve|their condition,
And admit them|(to) Paradise,|He has made it known|to them.
O you who believe |||If|you help|Allah,|He will help you|and make firm|your feet.
But those who|disbelieve,|destruction (is)|for them,|and He will cause to be lost|their deeds.
That|(is) because they|hate|what|Allah has revealed,||so He has made worthless|their deeds.
Do not|they travel|in|the earth|and see|how|was|(the) end|(of) those|before them?||Allah destroyed||[over] them,|and for the disbelievers (is)|its likeness.
That|(is) because|Allah|(is the) Protector|(of) those who|believe,|and that|the disbelievers -|(there is) no|protector|for them.
Indeed,|Allah|will admit|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|(to) Gardens,|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers,|but those who|disbelieve|they enjoy|and eat|as|eat|the cattle,|and the Fire|(will be) an abode|for them.
And how many|of|a town,|which|(was) stronger|(in) strength|than|your town|which|has driven you out?|We destroyed them,|so no|helper|for them.
Then is (he) who|is|on|a clear proof|from|his Lord|like (he) who,|is made attractive|to him|(the) evil|(of) his deeds|while they follow|their desires.
A parable|(of) Paradise|which|is promised|(to) the righteous.|Therein|(are) rivers|of|water|not|polluted,|and rivers|of|milk|not|changes|its taste,|and rivers|of|wine|delicious|for (the) drinkers,|and rivers|of|honey|purified,|and for them|therein|of|all|fruits|and forgiveness|from|their Lord|like he who||(will) abide forever|in|the Fire|and they will be given to drink|water|boiling|so it cuts into pieces|their intestines.
And among them|(are some) who|listen|to you,|until|when|they depart|from|you,|they say|to those who|were given|the knowledge,|"What|(has) he said|just now?"|Those -|(are) the ones|Allah has set a seal||upon|their hearts|and they follow|their desires.
And those who|accept guidance,|He increases them|(in) guidance|and gives them|their righteousness.
Then do|they wait|but|(for) the Hour|that|it should come to them|suddenly?|But indeed,|have come|its indications.|Then how|to them|when|has come to them|their reminder.
So know|that [He] -|(there is) no|god|but|Allah|and ask forgiveness|for your sin|and for the believing men|and the believing women.|And Allah|knows|your movement|and your resting places.
And say|those who|believe,|"Why not|has been revealed|a Surah?"|But when|is revealed|a Surah|precise|and is mentioned|in it|the fighting,|you see|those who,|in|their hearts,|(is) a disease|looking|at you -|a look|(of) one fainting||from|the death.|But more appropriate|for them
(Is) obedience|and a word|kind.|And when|(is) determined|the matter,|then if|they had been true|(to) Allah,|surely, it would have been|better|for them.
Then would|you perhaps,|if|you are given authority|that|you cause corruption|in|the earth|and cut off|your ties of kinship.
Those,|(are) the ones|Allah has cursed them,||so He made them deaf|and blinded|their vision.
Then do not|they ponder|(over) the Quran|or|upon|(their) hearts|(are) locks?
Indeed,|those who|return|on|their backs|after||what|(has) become clear|to them|(of) the guidance,|Shaitaan|enticed|[for] them|and prolonged hope|for them.
That|(is) because they|[they] said|to those who|hate|what|Allah has revealed,||"We will obey you|in|part|(of) the matter."|But Allah|knows|their secrets.
Then how,|when|take them in death|the Angels,|striking|their faces|and their backs?
That|(is) because they|followed|what|angered|Allah|and hated|His pleasure,|so He made worthless|their deeds.
Or do|think|those who|in|their hearts|(is) a disease|that|never|will Allah bring forth||their hatred?
And if|We willed|surely, We could show them to you|and you would know them|by their marks;|but surely, you will know them|by|(the) tone|(of their) speech.|And Allah|knows|your deeds.
And surely We will test you|until|We make evident|those who strive|among you|and the patient ones,|and We will test|your affairs.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|and turn away|from|(the) way of Allah||and oppose|the Messenger|after||[what]|(has been) made clear|to them|the guidance,|never|will they harm|Allah|(in) anything,|and He will make worthless|their deeds.
O you who believe |||Obey|Allah|and obey|the Messenger,|and (do) not|make vain|your deeds.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|and turn away|from|(the) way|(of) Allah,|then|died|while they|(were) disbelievers,|never|will Allah forgive||them.
So (do) not|weaken|and call|for|peace|while you|(are) superior,|and Allah|(is) with you|and never|will deprive you|(of) your deeds.
Only|the life|(of) the world|(is) play|and amusement.|And if|you believe|and fear (Allah)|He will give you|your rewards|and not|will ask you|(for) your wealth.
If|He were to ask you for it|and press you,|you will withhold|and He will bring forth|your hatred.
Here you are -|these,|called|to spend|in|(the) way|(of) Allah -|but among you|(are some) who|withhold,|and whoever|withholds,|then only|he withholds|from|himself.|But Allah|(is) Free of need,|while you|(are) the needy.|And if|you turn away|He will replace (you)|(with) a people|other than you,|then|not|they will be|(the) likes of you.
Indeed,|We have given victory,|to you|a victory|clear.
That may forgive|for you|Allah|what|preceded|of|your sins|and what|will follow|and complete|His favor|upon you|and guide you|(to) a Path|Straight,
And Allah may help you||(with) a help|mighty.
He|(is) the One Who|sent down|[the] tranquility|in(to)|(the) hearts|(of) the believers|that they may increase|(in) faith|with|their faith.|And for Allah|(are the) hosts|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and Allah||(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
That He may admit|the believing men|and the believing women|(to) Gardens|flow|from|underneath them|the rivers|(to) abide forever|therein,|and (to) remove|from them|their misdeeds,|and is|that|with|Allah|a success|great.
And He (may) punish|the hypocrite men|and the hypocrite women|and the polytheist men|and the polytheist women,|who assume|about Allah|an assumption|evil.|Upon them|(is) a turn|(of) evil,|and Allah's wrath is||upon them|and He has cursed them|and prepared|for them|Hell,|and evil|(is the) destination.
And for Allah|(are the) hosts|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|and Allah||(is) All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Indeed, We|[We] have sent you|(as) a witness|and (as) a bearer of glad tidings|and (as) a warner,
That you may believe|in Allah|and His Messenger|and (may) honor him|and respect him|and glorify Him|morning|and evening.
Indeed,|those who|pledge allegiance to you|only|they pledge allegiance|(to) Allah.|(The) Hand|(of) Allah|(is) over|their hands.|Then whoever|breaks (his oath)|then only|he breaks|against|himself,|and whoever|fulfils|what|he has covenanted with Allah,|||soon He will give him|a reward|great.
Will say|to you|those who remained behind|of|the Bedouins,|"Kept us busy|our properties|and our families,|so ask forgiveness|for us."|They say|with their tongues|what|is not|in|their hearts.|Say,|"Then who|has power|for you|against|Allah|(in) anything,|if|He intends|for you|harm|or|He intends|for you|a benefit?|Nay,|is|Allah|of what|you do|All-Aware.
Nay,|you thought|that|(would) never|return|the Messenger|and the believers|to|their families|ever,|that was made fair-seeming||in|your hearts.|And you assumed|an assumption|evil,|and you became|a people|ruined."
And whoever|(has) not believed||in Allah|and His Messenger|then indeed, We|[We] have prepared|for the disbelievers|a Blazing Fire.
And for Allah|(is the) kingdom|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|He forgives|whom|He wills|and punishes|whom|He wills.|And is|Allah|Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Will say|those who remained behind|when|you set forth|towards|(the) spoils of war|to take it,|"Allow us|(to) follow you."|They wish|to|change|(the) Words|(of) Allah.|Say,|"Never|will you follow us.|Thus|Allah said||before."||Then they will say,|"Nay,|you envy us."|Nay,|they were|not|understanding|except|a little.
Say|to those who remained behind|of|the Bedouins,|"You will be called|to|a people,|possessors of military might||great;|you will fight them,|or|they will submit.|Then if|you obey,|Allah will give you||a reward|good;|but if|you turn away|as|you turned away|before,||He will punish you|(with) a punishment|painful."
Not is|upon|the blind|any blame|and not|on|the lame|any blame|and not|on|the sick|any blame.|And whoever|obeys|Allah|and His Messenger,|He will admit him|(to) Gardens|flow|from|underneath them|the rivers,|but whoever|turns away,|He will punish him|(with) a punishment|painful.
Certainly|Allah was pleased||with|the believers|when|they pledged allegiance to you|under|the tree,|and He knew|what|(was) in|their hearts,|so He sent down|the tranquility|upon them|and rewarded them|(with) a victory|near,
And spoils of war|much|that they will take;|and is|Allah|All-Mighty,|All-Wise.
Allah has promised you||spoils of war|much|that you will take it,|and He has hastened|for you|this|and has withheld|(the) hands|(of) the people|from you -|that it may be|a sign|for the believers|and He may guide you|(to the) Path|Straight.
And others,|not|you had power|over them|surely|Allah encompassed||them,|and is|Allah|over|all|things|All-Powerful.
And if,|fight you,|those who|disbelieve,|surely they would turn|the backs.|Then|not|they would find|any protector|and not|any helper.
(The established) way|(of) Allah|which|passed away||before,||and never|you will find|in (the) way of Allah||any change.
And He|(is) the One Who|withheld|their hands|from you|and your hands|from them|within|Makkah,|after||that|He gave you victory|over them.|And is|Allah|of what|you do|All-Seer.
They|(are) those who|disbelieved|and hindered you|from|Al-Masjid Al-Haraam||while the offering|(was) prevented|from|reaching|its place (of sacrifice).|And if not|(for) men|believing|and women|believing|not|you knew them|that|you may trample them|and would befall you|from them|any harm|without|knowledge.|That Allah may admit||to|His Mercy|whom|He wills.|If|they had been apart|surely, We would have punished|those who|disbelieved|among them|(with) a punishment|painful.
When|had put|those who|disbelieved|in|their hearts|disdain -|(the) disdain|(of) the time of ignorance.|Then Allah sent down||His tranquility|upon|His Messenger|and upon|the believers|and made them adhere|(to the) word|(of) righteousness,|and they were|more deserving|of it|and worthy of it.|And is|Allah|of every|thing|All-Knower.
Certainly,|Allah has fulfilled||His Messenger's|vision|in truth.|Surely, you will enter|Al-Masjid Al-Haraam||if|Allah wills,||secure,|having shaved|your heads|and shortened,|not|fearing.|But He knew|what|not|you knew,|and He made|besides||that|a victory|near.
He|(is) the One Who|(has) sent|His Messenger|with guidance|and (the) religion,|the true|that He (may) make it prevail|over|the religions|all.|And sufficient is|Allah|(as) a Witness.
Muhammad|(is the) Messenger of Allah,||and those who|(are) with him|(are) firm|against|the disbelievers|and merciful|among themselves.|You see them|bowing|and prostrating,|seeking|Bounty|from Allah||and pleasure.|Their mark|(is) on|their faces|from|(the) trace|(of) the prostration.|That|(is) their similitude|in|the Taurah.|And their similitude|in|the Injeel,|(is) like a seed|(which) sends forth|its shoot|then strengthens it,|then it becomes thick|and it stands|upon|its stem|delighting|the sowers|that He (may) enrage|by them|the disbelievers.|Allah has promised||those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|among them,|forgiveness|and a reward|great.
O you who believe |||(Do) not|put (yourselves) forward -|before Allah|||and His Messenger|and fear Allah.||Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Knower.
O you who believe |||(Do) not|raise|your voices|above|(the) voice|(of) the Prophet,|and (do) not|be loud|to him|in speech|like (the) loudness|(of) some of you|to others,|lest|become worthless|your deeds|while you|(do) not|perceive.
Indeed,|those who|lower|their voices|(in) presence|(of the) Messenger of Allah -||those,|(are) the ones|Allah has tested||their hearts|for righteousness.|For them|(is) forgiveness|and a reward|great.
Indeed,|those who|call you|from|behind|the private chambers,|most of them|(do) not|understand.
And if|they|had been patient|until|you came out|to them|certainly it would be|better|for them.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
O you who believe |||If|comes to you|a wicked person|with information,|investigate,|lest|you harm|a people|in ignorance,|then you become,|over|what|you have done,|regretful.
And know|that|among you|(is the) Messenger of Allah.||If|he were to obey you|in|much|of|the matter,|surely you would be in difficulty,|but|Allah|has endeared|to you|the Faith|and has made it pleasing|in|your hearts|and has made hateful|to you|disbelief|and defiance|and disobedience.|Those|(are) they -|the guided ones.
A Bounty|from Allah||and favor.|And Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Wise.
And if|two parties|among|the believers|fight,|then make peace|between both of them.|But if|oppresses|one of them|on|the other,|then fight|one which|oppresses|until|it returns|to|(the) command|(of) Allah.|Then if|it returns,|then make peace|between them|with justice,|and act justly.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|those who act justly.
Only|the believers|(are) brothers,|so make peace|between|your brothers,|and fear Allah||so that you may|receive mercy.
O you who believe |||(Let) not|ridicule|a people|[of]|(another) people,|perhaps|that|they may be|better|than them;|and (let) not|women|[of]|(other) women|perhaps|that|they may be|better|than them.|And (do) not|insult|yourselves|and (do) not|call each other|by nicknames.|Wretched is|the name|(of) disobedience|after|the faith.|And whoever|(does) not|repent,|then those -|they|(are) the wrongdoers.
O you who believe |||Avoid|much|of|the assumption.|Indeed,|some|assumption|(is) sin.|And (do) not|spy|and (do) not|backbite|some of you|(to) others.|Would like|one of you|to|eat|(the) flesh|(of) his brother,|dead?|Nay, you would hate it.|And fear Allah;||indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Returning,|Most Merciful.
O mankind ||Indeed, We|created you|from|a male|and a female|and We made you|nations|and tribes|that you may know one another.|Indeed,|(the) most noble of you|near|Allah|(is the) most righteous of you.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Knower,|All-Aware.
Say|the Bedouins,|"We believe."|Say,|"Not|you believe;|but|say,|'We have submitted,'|and has not yet|entered|the faith|in|your hearts.|But if|you obey|Allah|and His Messenger,|not|He will deprive you|of|your deeds|anything.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Only|the believers|(are) those who|believe|in Allah|and His Messenger,|then|(do) not|doubt|but strive|with their wealth|and their lives|in|(the) way|(of) Allah.|Those|[they]|(are) the truthful."
Say,|"Will you acquaint|Allah|with your religion|while Allah|knows|what|(is) in|the heavens|and what|(is) in|the earth.|And Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower."
They consider (it) a favor|to you|that|they have accepted Islam.|Say,|"(Do) not|consider a favor|on me -|your Islam.|Nay,|Allah|has conferred a favor|upon you|that|He has guided you|to the faith,|if|you are|truthful.
Indeed,|Allah|knows|(the) unseen|(of) the heavens|and the earth.|And Allah|(is) All-Seer|of what|you do."
Qaf.|By the Quran,|the Glorious.
Nay,|they wonder|that|has come to them|a warner|from them.|So say|the disbelievers,|"This|(is) a thing|amazing.
What  When|we die|and have become|dust.|That|(is) a return|far."
Certainly,|We know|what|diminishes|the earth|of them,|and with Us|(is) a Book|guarded.
Nay,|they denied|the truth|when|it came (to) them,|so they|(are) in|a state|confused.
Then do not|they look|at|the sky|above them -|how|We structured it|and adorned it|and not|for it|any|rifts?
And the earth,|We have spread it out|and cast|therein|firmly set mountains|and We made to grow|therein|of|every|kind|beautiful,
Giving insight|and a reminder|for every|slave|who turns.
And We have sent down|from|the sky|water|blessed,|then We caused to grow|thereby|gardens|and grain|(for) the harvest,
And the palms trees|tall -|for it|(are) layers|arranged.
A provision|for the slaves,|and We give life|therewith|(to) a land|dead.|Thus|(will be) the coming forth.
Denied|before them|(the) people|(of) Nuh|and (the) companions|(of) Ar-Raas|and Thamud,
And Aad|and Firaun|and (the) brothers|(of) Lut,
And (the) companions|(of) the wood|and (the) people|(of) Tubba.|All|denied|the Messengers,|so was fulfilled|My Threat.
Were We then tired|with the creation|the first?|Nay,|they|(are) in|doubt|about|a creation|new.
And certainly|We created|man|and We know|what|whispers|to him|his soul,|and We|(are) nearer|to him|than|(his) jugular vein.|
When|receive|the two receivers|on|the right|and on|the left|seated.
Not|he utters|any|word|but|with him|(is) an observer|ready.
And will come|(the) stupor|(of) death|in truth,|"That|(is) what|you were|[from it]|avoiding."
And will be blown|[in]|the trumpet.|That|(is the) Day|(of) the Warning.
And will come|every|soul,|with it|a driver|and a witness.
"Certainly|you were|in|heedlessness|of|this.|So We have removed|from you|your cover,|so your sight|today|(is) sharp."
And (will) say|his companion,|"This|(is) what|(is) with me|ready."
"Throw|in(to)|Hell|every|disbeliever|stubborn,
Forbidder|of good,|transgressor|doubter,
Who|made|with|Allah|a god|another;|so throw him|in(to)|the punishment|the severe."
Will say|his companion,|"Our Lord,|not|I made him transgress,|but|he was|in|error|far."
He will say,|"(Do) not|dispute|(in) My presence|and indeed,|I sent forth|to you|the Warning.
Not|will be changed|the word|with Me,|and not|I Am|unjust|to My slaves."
(The) Day|We will say|to Hell,|"Are|you filled?"|And it will say,|"Are|(there) any|more?"
And will be brought near|the Paradise|to the righteous,|not|far.
"This|(is) what|you were promised,|for everyone|who turns|(and) who keeps,
Who|feared|the Most Gracious|in the unseen,|and came|with a heart|returning.
Enter it|in peace.|That|(is) a Day|(of) Eternity."
For them|whatever|they wish|therein|and with Us|(is) more.
And how many|We destroyed|before them|of|a generation,|they|(were) stronger|than them|(in) power.|so they explored|throughout|the lands.|Is (there)|any|place of escape?
Indeed,|in|that|surely, is a reminder|for (one) who,|is -|for him|a heart|or|(who) gives ear||while he|(is) a witness.
And certainly,|We created|the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between both of them|in|six|periods,|and (did) not|touch Us|any|fatigue.
So be patient|over|what|they say|and glorify|(the) praise|(of) your Lord,|before|(the) rising|(of) the sun|and before|the setting,
And of|the night|glorify Him|and after|the prostration.
And listen |(The) Day|will call|the caller|from|a place|near,
(The) Day|they will hear|the Blast|in truth.|That|(is the) Day|(of) coming forth.
Indeed, We|[We]|[We] give life|and [We] cause death,|and to Us|(is) the final return.
(The) Day|will split|the earth|from them,|hurrying.|That|(is) a gathering|for Us|easy.
We|know best|[of] what|they say,|and not|(are) you|over them|the one to compel.|But remind|with the Quran|whoever|fears|My threat.
By those scattering,|dispersing,
And those carrying|a load,
And those sailing|(with) ease,
And those distributing|Command,
Indeed, what|you are promised|(is) surely true,
And indeed,|the Judgment|(is) surely to occur.
By the heaven|full of|pathways.
Indeed, you|(are) surely in|a speech|differing.
Deluded away|from it|(is he) who|is deluded.
Cursed be|the liars,
Those who|[they]|(are) in|flood|(of) heedlessness.
They ask,|"When|(is the) Day|(of) Judgment?"
A Day,|they|over|the Fire|will be tried,
"Taste|your trial.|This|(is) what|you were|for it|seeking to hasten."
Indeed,|the righteous|(will be) in|Gardens|and springs,
Taking|what|their Lord has given them.||Indeed, they|were|before|that|good-doers.
They used to|little|of|the night|[what]|sleep.
And in the hours before dawn|they|would ask forgiveness,
And in|their wealth|(was the) right|(of) those who asked|and the deprived.
And in|the earth|(are) signs|for those who are certain,
And in|yourselves.|Then will not|you see?
And in|the heaven|(is) your provision|and what|you are promised.
Then by (the) Lord|(of) the heaven|and the earth,|indeed, it|(is) surely (the) truth|(just) as|[what]|you|speak.
Has|reached  you|(the) narration|(of the) guests|(of) Ibrahim|the honored?
When|they entered|upon him|and said,|"Peace."|He said,|"Peace,|a people|unknown."
Then he went|to|his household|and came|with a calf|fat,
And he placed it near|[to] them,|he said,|"Will not|you eat?"
Then he felt|from them|a fear.|They said,|"(Do) not|fear,"|and they gave him glad tidings|of a son|learned.
Then came forward|his wife|with|a loud voice,|and struck|her face|and she said,|"An old woman|barren "
They said,|"Thus|said|your Lord.|Indeed, He|[He]|(is) the All-Wise,|the All-Knower."
He said,|"Then what|(is) your mission,|O messengers?"|
They said,|"Indeed, we|[we] have been sent|to|a people|criminal,
That we may send down|upon them|stones|of|clay,
Marked|by your Lord||for the transgressors."
Then We brought out|(those) who|were|therein|of|the believers.
But not|We found|therein|other than|a house|of|the Muslims.
And We left|therein|a Sign|for those who|fear|the punishment|the painful.
And in|Musa,|when|We sent him|to|Firaun|with an authority|clear.
But he turned away|with his supporters|and said,|"A magician|or|a madman."
So We took him|and his hosts|and We threw them|into|the sea,|while he|(was) blameworthy.
And in|Aad,|when|We sent|against them|the wind|the barren.
Not|it left|any|thing|it came|upon it,|but|it made it|like disintegrated ruins.
And in|Thamud,|when|was said|to them,|"Enjoy (yourselves)|for|a time."
But they rebelled|against|(the) Command|(of) their Lord,|so seized them|the thunderbolt|while they|were looking.
Then not|they were able to|[of]|stand|and not|they could|help themselves.
And (the) people|(of) Nuh|before;||indeed, they|were|a people|defiantly disobedient.
And the heaven|We constructed it|with strength,|and indeed, We|(are) surely (its) Expanders.
And the earth,|We have spread it;|how excellent|(are) the Spreaders 
And of|every|thing|We have created|pairs,|so that you may|remember.
So flee|to|Allah,|indeed, I am|to you|from Him|a warner|clear.
And (do) not|make|with|Allah|god|another.|Indeed, I am|to you|from Him|a warner|clear.
Likewise|not|came|(to) those|before them||any|Messenger|but|they said,|"A magician|or|a madman."
Have they transmitted it to them?||Nay,|they|(are) a people|transgressing.
So turn away|from them,|for not|you|(are) to be blamed.
And remind,|for indeed,|the reminder|benefits|the believers.
And not|I have created|the jinn|and the mankind|except|that they worship Me.
Not|I want|from them|any|provision|and not|I want|that|they (should) feed Me.
Indeed,|Allah,|He|(is) the All-Provider,|Possessor|(of) Power|the Strong.
So indeed,|for those who|do wrong,|(is) a portion|like|(the) portion|(of) their companions,|so let them not ask Me to hasten.|
Then woe|to those who|disbelieve|from|their Day|which|they are promised.
By the Mount,
And by (the) Book|written
In|parchment|unrolled,
By the House|frequented
By the roof|raised high
By the sea|filled
Indeed,|(the) punishment|(of) your Lord|(will) surely occur.
Not|for it|any|preventer.
(On the) Day|will shake|the heaven|(with violent) shake
And will move away,|the mountains|(with an awful) movement
Then woe,|that Day,|to the deniers,
Who|[they]|in|(vain) discourse|are playing.
(The) Day|they will be thrust|(in)to|(the) Fire|(of) Hell|(with) a thrust.
"This|(is) the Fire|which|you used to|[of it]|deny.
Then is this magic,||or|you|(do) not|see?
Burn in it|then be patient|or|(do) not|be patient,|(it is) same|for you.|Only|you are being recompensed|(for) what|you used to|do."
Indeed,|the righteous|(will be) in|Gardens|and pleasure,
Enjoying|in what|has given them|their Lord,|and protected them|their Lord|(from the) punishment|(of) Hellfire.
"Eat|and drink|(in) satisfaction|for what|you used to|do."
Reclining|on|thrones|lined up,|and We will marry them|to fair ones|(with) large eyes.
And those who|believed|and followed them|their offspring|in faith,|We will join|with them|their offspring|and not|We will deprive them|of|their deeds|(in) any|thing.|Every|person|for what|he earned|(is) pledged.
And We will provide them|with fruit|and meat|from what|they desire.
They will pass to one another|therein|a cup,|no|ill speech|therein|and no|sin.
And will circulate|among them|boys|for them,|as if they (were)|pearls|well-protected.
And will approach|some of them|to|others|inquiring.
They will say,|"Indeed, we|[we] were|before|among|our families|fearful,
But Allah conferred favor||upon us,|and protected us|(from the) punishment|(of) the Scorching Fire.
Indeed, we|[we] used to|before||call Him.|Indeed, He|[He]|(is) the Most Kind,|the Most Merciful."
Therefore remind,|for not|you|(are) by (the) grace|(of) your Lord|a soothsayer,|and not|a madman.
Or|(do) they say,|"A poet,|we wait|for him|a misfortune of time."|
Say,|"Wait,|for indeed I am,|with you,|among|those who wait."
Or|command them|their minds|this,|or|they|(are) a people|transgressing?
Or|(do) they say,|"He has made it up"|Nay,|not|they believe.
Then let them bring|a statement|like it,|if|they are|truthful.
Or|they were created|of|nothing,||or|(are) they|the creators?
Or|(did) they create|the heavens|and the earth?|Nay,|not|they are certain.
Or|with them|(are the) treasures|(of) your Lord|or|(are) they|the controllers?
Or|for them|(is) a stairway,|they listen|therewith?|Then let bring,|their listener,|an authority|clear.
Or|for Him|(are) daughters|while for you|(are) sons?
Or|(do) you ask from them|a payment,|so they|from|a debt|(are) overburdened.
Or|with them|(is) the unseen,|so they|write (it) down?
Or|(do) they intend|a plot?|But those who|disbelieve,|themselves|(are in) the plot.
Or|for them|a god|other than|Allah?|Glory be|(to) Allah|from what|they associate (with Him).
And if|they were to see|a portion|from|the sky|falling,|they will say,|"Clouds|heaped up."
So leave them|until|they meet|their Day|which|in it|they will faint.
(The) Day|not|will avail|to them|their plotting|(in) anything,|and not|they|will be helped.
And indeed,|for those who|do wrong,|(is) a punishment|before|that,|but|most of  them|(do) not|know.
So be patient,|for (the) Command|(of) your Lord,|for indeed, you|(are) in Our Eyes.|And glorify|(the) praise|(of) your Lord|when|you arise,
And of|the night,|glorify Him,|and after|the stars.
By the star|when|it goes down,
Not|has strayed|your companion|and not|has he erred,
And not|he speaks|from|the desire.
Not|it|(is) except|a revelation|revealed,
Has taught him|the (one) mighty|(in) power,
Possessor of soundness.||And he rose,
While he|(was) in the horizon -|the highest.
Then|he approached|and came down,
And was|(at) a distance|(of) two bow-(lengths)|or|nearer.
So he revealed|to|His slave|what|he revealed.
Not|lied|the heart|what|it saw.
Then will you dispute with him|about|what|he saw?
And certainly|he saw him|(in) descent|another,
Near|(the) Lote Tree|(of) the utmost boundary,
Near it|(is the) Garden|(of) Abode.
When|covered|the Lote Tree|what|covers,
Not|swerved|the sight|and not|it transgressed.
Certainly|he saw|of|(the) Signs|(of) his Lord|the Greatest.
So have you seen|the Laat|and the Uzza,
And Manaat|the third,|the other?
Is for you|the male|and for Him|the female?
This,|then,|(is) a division|unfair.
Not|they|(are) except|names|you have named them,|you|and your forefathers,|not|has Allah sent down||for it|any|authority.|Not|they follow|except|assumption|and what|desire|the(ir) souls.|And certainly|has come to them|from|their Lord|the guidance.
Or|(is) for man|what|he wishes?
But for Allah|(is) the last|and the first.
And how many|of|(the) Angels|in|the heavens|not|will avail|their intercession|anything|except|after||[that]|Allah has given permission||for whom|He wills|and approves.
Indeed,|those who|(do) not|believe|in the Hereafter,|surely they name|the Angels|name(s)|(of) female,
And not|for them|about it|any|knowledge.|Not|they follow|but|assumption.|And indeed,|the assumption|(does) not|avail|against|the truth|anything.
So turn away|from|(him) who|turns away|from|Our Reminder|and not|he desires|except|the life|(of) the world.
That|(is) their sum|of|knowledge.|Indeed,|your Lord|(is) He (Who)|knows best|(he) who|strays|from|His Path,|and He|knows best|(he) who|is guided.
And for Allah|(is) whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth|that He may recompense|those who|do evil|with what|they have done|and recompense|those who|do good|with the best.
Those who|avoid|great|sins|and the immoralities|except|the small faults;|indeed,|your Lord|(is) vast|(in) forgiveness.|He|(is) most knowing about you||when|He produced you|from|the earth|and when|you (were)|fetuses|in|(the) wombs|(of) your mothers.|So (do) not|ascribe purity|(to) yourselves.|He|knows best|(he) who|fears.
Did you see|the one who|turned away
And gave|a little,|and withheld?
Is with him|(the) knowledge|(of) the unseen,|so he|sees?
Or|not|he was informed|with what|(was) in|(the) Scriptures|(of) Musa,
And Ibrahim,|who|fulfilled?
That not|will bear|a bearer of burdens|(the) burden|(of) another,
And that|is not|for man|except|what|he strives (for),
And that|his striving|will soon|be seen.
Then|he will be recompensed for it|the recompense|the fullest.
And that|to|your Lord|(is) the final goal.
And that He|[He]|makes (one) laugh|and makes (one) weep.
And that He|[He]|causes death|and gives life.
And that He|created|the pairs,|the male|and the female
From|a semen-drop|when|it is emitted.
And that|upon Him|(is) the bringing forth|another.
And that He|[He]|enriches|and suffices.
And that He|[He]|(is the) Lord|(of) the Sirius.
And that He|destroyed|Aad|the first,
And Thamud,|so not|He spared,
And (the) people|(of) Nuh|before.||Indeed, they|they were||more unjust|and more rebellious.
And the overturned cities|He overthrew,
So covered them|what|covered.
Then which (of)|the Favors|(of) your Lord,|will you doubt?
This|(is) a warner,|from|the warners|the former.
Has approached|the Approaching Day.
Not is|for it|besides||Allah|any remover.
Then of|this|statement|you wonder?
And you laugh|and (do) not|weep,
While you|amuse (yourselves)?
So prostrate|to Allah|and worship (Him).
Has come near|the Hour|and has split|the moon.
And if|they see|a Sign,|they turn away|and say,|"Magic|continuing."
And they denied|and followed|their desires,|but (for) every|matter|(will be a) settlement.
And certainly|has come to them|of|the information|wherein||(is) deterrence,
Wisdom|perfect,|but not|will avail|the warnings.
So turn away|from them.|(The) Day,|will call|the caller|to|a thing|terrible,
(Will be) humbled|their eyes|they will come forth|from|the graves|as if they (were)|locusts|spreading,
Racing ahead|towards|the caller.|Will say|the disbelievers,|"This|(is) a Day|difficult."
Denied|before them|(the) people|(of) Nuh,|and they denied|Our slave|and said,|"A madman,"|and he was repelled.
So he called|his Lord,|"I am|one overpowered,|so help."
So We opened|(the) gates|(of) heaven|with water|pouring down
And We caused to burst|the earth|(with) springs,|so met|the water(s)|for|a matter|already|predestined.
And We carried him|on|(ark) made of planks||and nails,
Sailing|before Our eyes,|a reward|for (he) who|was|denied.
And certainly|We left it|(as) a Sign,|so is (there)|any|who will receive admonition?
So how|was|My punishment|and My warnings?
And certainly|We have made easy|the Quran|for remembrance,|so is (there)|any|who will receive admonition?
Denied|Aad;|so how|was|My punishment|and My warnings?
Indeed, We|[We] sent|upon them|a wind|furious|on|a day|(of) misfortune|continuous,
Plucking out|men|as if they (were)|trunks|(of) date-palms|uprooted.
So how|was|My punishment|and My warnings?
And certainly,|We have made easy|the Quran|for remembrance,|so is (there)|any|who will receive admonition?
Denied|Thamud|the warnings,
And said,|"Is (it) a human being|among us|one,|(that) we should follow him?|Indeed, we|then|(will be) surely in|error|and madness.
Has been sent|the Reminder|to him|from|among us?|Nay,|he|(is) a liar|insolent."
They will know|tomorrow|who|(is) the liar,|the insolent one.
Indeed, We|(are) sending|the she-camel|(as) a trial|for them,|so watch them|and be patient.
And inform them|that|the water|(is) to be shared|between them,|each|drink|attended.
But they called|their companion|and he took|and hamstrung.
So how|was|My punishment|and My warnings.
Indeed, We|[We] sent|upon them|thunderous blast|single,|and they became|like dry twig fragments|(used by) a fence builder.
And certainly|We have made easy|the Quran|for remembrance,|so is (there)|any|who will receive admonition?
Denied|(the) people|(of) Lut,|the warnings.
Indeed, We|[We] sent|upon them|a storm of stones,|except|(the) family|(of) Lut,|We saved them|by dawn
(As) a favor|from|Us.|Thus|We reward|(one) who|(is) grateful.
And certainly|he warned them|(of) Our seizure,|but they disputed|the warnings.
And certainly|they demanded from him||his guests,|so We blinded|their eyes.|"So taste|My punishment|and My warnings."
And certainly|seized them in the morning|early|a punishment|abiding.
So taste|My punishment|and My warnings.
And certainly|We have made easy|the Quran|for remembrance,|so is (there)|any|who will receive admonition?
And certainly|came|(to the) people|(of) Firaun|warnings.
They denied|Our Signs,|all of them,|so We seized them|(with) a seizure|(of) All-Mighty,|(the) Powerful One.
Are your disbelievers,|better|than|those,|or|for you|(is) an exemption|in|the Scriptures?
Or|(do) they say,|"We|(are) an assembly|helping (each other)?"
Soon will be defeated|(their) assembly,|and they will turn|(their) backs.
Nay,|the Hour|(is) their promised time,|and the Hour|(will be) more grievous|and more bitter.
Indeed,|the criminals|(are) in|an error|and madness.
(The) Day|they will be dragged|into|the Fire|on|their faces,|"Taste|(the) touch|(of) Hell."
Indeed, [We]|every|thing|We created it|by a measure.
And not|(is) Our Command|but|one,|like the twinkling|(of) the eye.
And certainly|We destroyed|your kinds,|so is (there)|any|who will receive admonition?
And every|thing|they did|(is) in|the written records.
And every|small|and big|(is) written down.
Indeed,|the righteous|(will be) in|gardens|and river,
In|a seat|(of) honor|near|a King|Most Powerful.
The Most Gracious
He taught|the Quran.
He created|[the] man.
He taught him|[the] speech.
The sun|and the moon|by (precise) calculation,
And the stars|and the trees|both prostrate.
And the heaven,|He raised it|and He has set up|the balance,
That not|you may transgress|in|the balance.
And establish|the weight|in justice|and (do) not|make deficient|the balance.
And the earth,|He laid it|for the creatures,
Therein|(is) fruit|and date-palms|having|sheaths,
And the grain|having|husk|and scented plants.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
He created|the man|from|clay|like the pottery.
And He created|the jinn|from|a smokeless flame|of|fire.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Lord|(of) the two Easts|and Lord|(of) the two Wests.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
He released|the two seas,|meeting.
Between both of them|(is) a barrier,|not|they transgress.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Come forth|from both of them|the pearl|and the coral.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
And for Him|(are) the ships|elevated|in|the sea|like mountains.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Everyone|who|(is) on it|(will) perish.
But will remain|(the) Face|(of) your Lord,|(the) Owner|(of) Majesty|and Honor.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Asks Him|whoever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|Every|day|He|(is) in|a matter.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
We will attend|to you,|O you|two classes 
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
O assembly|(of) the jinn|and the men |If|you are able|to|pass beyond|[of]|(the) regions|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|then pass.|Not|you (can) pass|except|by authority.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Will be sent|against both of you|a flame|of|fire|and smoke,|and not|you will (be able to) defend yourselves.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Then when|is split|the heaven,|and it becomes|rose-colored|like murky oil.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Then (on) that Day|not|will be asked|about|his sin|any man|and not|any jinn.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Will be known|the criminals|by their marks|and will be seized|by the forelocks|and the feet.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
This|(is) Hell|which|deny|[of it]|the criminals.
They will go around|between it|and between|scalding water,|heated.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
But for (him) who|fears|(the) standing|(before) his Lord|(are) two gardens.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Having|branches.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
In both of them|(are) two springs,|flowing.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
In both of them|[of]|(are) every|fruits|(in) pairs.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Reclining|on|couches,|(whose) inner linings|(are) of|brocade,|and (the) fruit|(of) both the gardens|(is) near.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
In them|(will be) companions of modest gaze||not|has touched them|any man|before them|and not|any jinn.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
As if they were|rubies|and coral.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Is|(the) reward|for the good|but|good?
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Besides these two||(are) two gardens.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Dark green.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
In both of them|(are) two springs,|gushing forth.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
In both of them|(are) fruits|and date-palms|and pomegranates.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
In them|(are) good|and beautiful ones.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Fair ones|restrained|in|the pavilions.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Not|has touched them|any man|before them|and not|any jinn.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Reclining|on|cushions|green,|and carpets|beautiful.
So which|(of the) favors|(of) your Lord|will you both deny?
Blessed is|(the) name|(of) your Lord,|Owner|(of) Majesty|and Honor.
When|occurs|the Event,
Not|at its occurrence|a denial
Bringing down,|raising up,
When|will be shaken|the earth|(with) a shaking,
And will be crumbled|the mountains|(with awful) crumbling.
So they become|dust particles|dispersing.
And you will become|kinds|three.
Then (the) companions|(of) the right,|what|(are the) companions|(of) the right?
And (the) companions|(of) the left,|what|(are the) companions|(of) the left?
And the foremost|(are) the foremost,
Those|(are) the nearest ones.
In|Gardens|(of) Pleasure,
A company|of|the former (people),
And a few|of|the later (people),
On|thrones|decorated,
Reclining,|on them|facing each other.
Will circulate|among them|boys|immortal,
With vessels|and jugs|and a cup|from|a flowing stream,
Not|they will get headache|therefrom|and not|they will get intoxicated
And fruits|of what|they select,
And (the) flesh|(of) fowls|of what|they desire.
And fair ones|(with) large eyes,
Like|pearls|well-protected,
A reward|for what|they used to|do.
Not|they will hear|therein|vain talk|and not|sinful (speech),
Except|a saying,|"Peace,|Peace."
And (the) companions|(of) the right,|what|(are the) companions|(of) the right?
Among|lote trees|thornless,
And banana trees|layered,
And shade|extended,
And water|poured forth,
And fruit|abundant,
Not|limited|and not|forbidden,
And (on) couches|raised.
Indeed, We|[We] have produced them|(into) a creation,
And We have made them|virgins,
Devoted,|well-matched.
For (the) companions|(of) the right,
A company|of|the former (people),
And a company|of|the later (people).
And (the) companions|(of) the left,|what|(are the) companions|(of) the left?
In|scorching fire|and scalding water,
And a shade|of|black smoke,
Not|cool|and not|pleasant.
Indeed, they|were|before|that|indulging in affluence.
And were|persisting|in|the sin|the great,
And they used to|say,|"When|we die|and become|dust|and bones,|will we|surely be resurrected?
Or our forefathers?|
Say,|"Indeed,|the former|and the later (people)
Surely, will be gathered|for|(the) appointment|(of) a Day|well-known."
Then|indeed you,|O those astray ||The deniers,
Will surely eat|from|(the) tree|of|Zaqqum.
Then will fill|with it|the bellies,
And drink|over it|[from]|the scalding water,
And will drink|(as) drinking|(of) the thirsty camels.
This|(is) their hospitality|(on the) Day|(of) Judgment.
We|[We] created you,|so why (do) not|you admit the truth?
Do you see|what|you emit?
Is it you|who create it|or|(are) We|the Creators?
We|[We] have decreed|among you|the death|and not|We|(are to be) outrun,
[On]|That|We (will) change|your likeness[es]|and produce you|in|what|not|you know.
And certainly|you know|the creation|the first,|so why not|you take heed?
And do you see|what|you sow?
Is it you (who)|cause it to grow|or|(are) We|grower?
If|We willed|We (would) surely, make it|debris,|then you would remain|wondering,
"Indeed, we|surely are laden with debt,
Nay,|we|(are) deprived."
Do you see|the water,|which|you drink?
Is it you|who send it down|from|the rain clouds,|or|(are) We|the sender?
If|We willed,|We (could) make it|salty,|then why are you not grateful?|
Do you see|the Fire,|which|you ignite?
Is it you|who produced|its tree|or|We|(are) the producer?
We|(have) made it|a reminder|and a provision|for the wayfarers in the desert.
So glorify|(the) name|(of) your Lord,|the Most Great.
But nay,|I swear|by setting|(of) the stars,
And indeed, it|(is) surely an oath,|if|you know -|great,
Indeed, it|(is) surely, a Quran|noble,
In|a Book|well-guarded,
Not|touch it|except|the purified.
A Revelation|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
Then is it to this|statement|that you|(are) indifferent?
And you make|your provision|that you|deny.
Then why not|when|it reaches|the throat,
And you|(at) that time|look on,
And We|(are) nearer|to him|than you|but|you (do) not see,|
Then why not,|if|you are|not|to be recompensed,
Bring it back,|if|you are|truthful.
Then|if|he was|of|those brought near,
Then rest|and bounty|and a Garden|(of) Pleasure.
And|if|he was|of|(the) companions|(of) the right,
Then, peace|for you;|[from]|(the) companions|(of) the right.
But|if|he was|of|the deniers,|the astray,
Then, hospitality|of|(the) scalding water,
And burning|(in) Hellfire.
Indeed,|this|surely, it|(is the) truth|certain.
So glorify|(the) name|(of) your Lord,|the Most Great.
Glorifies|[to] Allah|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth,|and He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
For Him|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|He gives life|and causes death,|and He|(is) over|all|things|All-Powerful.
He|(is) the First|and the Last,|and the Apparent|and the Unapparent,|and He|(is) of every|thing|All-Knower.
He|(is) the One Who|created|the heavens|and the earth|in|six|periods,|then|He rose|over|the Throne.|He knows|what|penetrates|in(to)|the earth|and what|comes forth|from it,|and what|descends|from|the heaven|and what|ascends|therein;|and He|(is) with you|wherever||you are.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
For Him|(is the) dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|and to|Allah|will be returned|the matters.
He merges|the night|into|the day|and He merges|the day|into|the night,|and He|(is) All-Knower|of what is in the breasts.|
Believe|in Allah|and His Messenger|and spend|of what|He has made you|trustees|therein.|And those who|believe|among you|and spend,|for them|(is) a reward|great.
And what|(is) for you|(that) not|you believe|in Allah|while the Messenger|calls you|that you believe|in your Lord,|and indeed,|He has taken|your covenant|if|you are|believers.
He|(is) the One Who|sends down|upon|His slave|Verses|clear|that He may bring you out|from|the darkness[es]|into|the light.|And indeed,|Allah|to you|(is the) Most Kind,|(the) Most Merciful.
And what|(is) for you|that not|you spend|in|(the) way|(of) Allah?|while for Allah|(is the) heritage|(of) the heavens|and the earth?|Not|are equal|among you|(those) who|spent|before||the victory|and fought.|Those|(are) greater|(in) degree|than|those who|spent|afterwards||and fought.|But to all,|Allah has promised||the best.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Aware.
Who (is)|the one who|will loan||(to) Allah|a loan|goodly,|so He will multiply it|for him|and for him|(is) a reward|noble?
(On the) Day|you will see|the believing men|and the believing women,|running,|their light|before them||and on their right,|"Glad tidings for you|this Day -|gardens|flowing|from|underneath it|the rivers,|abiding forever|therein.|That|[it]|(is) the success|the great."
(On the) Day|will say|the hypocrite men|and the hypocrite women|to those who|believed,|"Wait for us,|we may acquire|of|your light."|It will be said,|"Go back|behind you|and seek|light."|Then will be put up|between them|a wall,|for it|a gate|its interior,|in it|(is) mercy|but its exterior,|facing towards [it]||the punishment.
They will call them,|"Were not|we|with you?"|They will say,|"Yes,|but you|led to temptation|yourselves|and you awaited|and you doubted|and deceived you|the wishful thinking|until|came|(the) Command|(of) Allah.|And deceived you|about Allah|the deceiver.
So today|not|will be taken|from you|any ransom|and not|from|those who|disbelieved.|Your abode|(is) the Fire;|it|(is) your protector|and wretched is|the destination.
Has not|come (the) time|for those who|believed|that|become humble|their hearts|at (the) remembrance (of) Allah||and what|has come down|of|the truth?|And not|they become|like those who|were given|the Book|before,||(and) was prolonged|for them|the term,|so hardened|their hearts;|and many|of them|(are) defiantly disobedient.
Know|that|Allah|gives life|(to) the earth|after|its death.|Indeed,|We have made clear|to you|the Signs|so that you may|understand.
Indeed,|the men who give charity|and the women who give charity,|and who lend|(to) Allah|a loan|goodly,|it will be multiplied|for them,|and for them|(is) a reward|noble.
And those who|believe|in Allah|and His Messengers,|[those]|they|(are) the truthful|and the martyrs,|(are) with|their Lord.|For them|(is) their reward|and their light.|But those who|disbelieve|and deny|Our Verses,|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Hellfire.
Know|that|the life|(of) the world|(is) play|and amusement|and adornment|and boasting|among you|and competition in increase|of|the wealth|and the children,|like (the) example|(of) a rain,|pleases|the tillers|its growth;|then|it dries|and you see it|turning yellow;|then|becomes|debris.|And in|the Hereafter|(is) a punishment|severe|and forgiveness|from|Allah|and Pleasure.|But not|(is) the life|(of) the world|except|(the) enjoyment|(of) delusion.
Race|to|(the) forgiveness|from|your Lord,|and a Garden|its width|(is) like (the) width|(of) the heaven|and the earth,|prepared|for those who|believe|in Allah|and His Messengers.|That|(is the) Bounty|(of) Allah,|He gives it|(to) whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) the Possessor of Bounty,||the Great.
Not|strikes|any|disaster|in|the earth|and not|in|yourselves,|but|in|a Register|before||that|We bring it into existence.|Indeed,|that|for|Allah|(is) easy.
So that you may not|grieve|over|what|has escaped you,|and (do) not|exult|at what|He has given you.|And Allah|(does) not|love|every|self-deluded|boaster,
Those who|are stingy|and enjoin|(on) the people|stinginess.|And whoever|turns away,|then indeed,|Allah,|He|(is) Free of need,|the Praiseworthy.
Certainly|We sent|Our Messengers|with clear proofs|and We sent down|with them|the Scripture|and the Balance|that may establish|the people|justice.|And We sent down|[the] iron,|wherein|(is) power|mighty|and benefits|for the people,|and so that Allah may make evident||(he) who|helps Him|and His Messengers,|unseen.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Strong|All-Mighty.
And certainly|We sent|Nuh|and Ibrahim,|and We placed|in|their offspring|Prophethood|and the Scripture;|and among them|(is) a guided one,|but most|of them|(are) defiantly disobediently.
Then|We sent|on|their footsteps|Our Messengers|and We followed|with Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|and We gave him|the Injeel.|And We placed|in|(the) hearts|(of) those who|followed him|compassion|and mercy.|But monasticism|they innovated -|not|We prescribed it|for them -|only|seeking|(the) pleasure|(of) Allah,|but not|they observed it|(with) right|observance.|So We gave|those who|believed|among them|their reward,|but most|of them|(are) defiantly disobediently.
O you who believe |||Fear|Allah|and believe|in His Messenger;|He will give you|double portion|of|His Mercy|and He will make|for you|a light,|you will walk|with it,|and He will forgive|you.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
So that may|know|(the) People|(of) the Book|that not|they have power|over|anything|from|(the) Bounty|(of) Allah,|and that|the Bounty|(is) in Allah's Hand;||He gives it|(to) whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) the Possessor of Bounty||the Great.
Indeed,|Allah has heard||(the) speech|(of) one who|disputes with you|concerning|her husband|and she directs her complaint|to|Allah.|And Allah|hears|(the) dialogue of both of you.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Hearer,|All-Seer.
Those who|pronounce zihar|among you|[from]|(to) their wives,|not|they|(are) their mothers.|Not|(are) their mothers|except|those who|gave them birth.|And indeed, they|surely say|an evil|[of]|[the] word|and a lie.|But indeed,|Allah|(is) surely, Oft-Pardoning,|Oft-Forgiving.
And those who|pronounce zihar|[from]|(to) their wives|then|go back|on what|they said,|then freeing|(of) a slave|before||[that]|they touch each other.|That|you are admonished|to it.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Aware.
Then whoever|(does) not|find,|then fasting|(for) two months|consecutively|before||[that]|they both touch each other.|But (he) who|not|is able|then (the) feeding|(of) sixty|needy one(s).|That -|so that you may believe|in Allah|and His Messenger,|and these|(are the) limits|(of) Allah,|and for the disbelievers|(is) a punishment|painful.
Indeed,|those who|oppose|Allah|and His Messenger|(will) be disgraced|as|were disgraced|those|before them.||And certainly|We have sent down|Verses|clear.|And for the disbelievers|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
(On the) Day|(when) Allah will raise them||all|and inform them|of what|they did.|Allah has recorded it||while they forgot it.|And Allah|(is) over|all|things|a Witness.
Do not|you see|that|Allah|knows|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth?|Not|there is|any|secret counsel|(of) three|but|He (is)|(the) fourth of them,|and not|five|but|He (is)|(the) sixth of them,|and not|less|than|that|and not|more|but|He|(is) with them|wherever||they are.|Then|He will inform them|of what|they did|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|Indeed,|Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knower.
Do not|you see|[to]|those who|were forbidden|from|secret counsels,|then|they return|to what|they were forbidden|from [it],|and they hold secret counsels|for sin|and aggression|and disobedience|(to) the Messenger?|And when|they come to you,|they greet you|with what|not|greets you|therewith|Allah,|and they say|among|themselves,|"Why (does) not|Allah punish us||for what|we say?"|Sufficient (for) them|(is) Hell,|they will burn in it|and worst is|the destination.
O you who believe |||When|you hold secret counsel|then (do) not|hold secret counsel|for sin|and aggression|and disobedience|(to) the Messenger,|but hold secret counsel|for righteousness|and piety.|And fear|Allah,|the One Who,|to Him|you will be gathered.
Only|the secret counsels|(are) from|the Shaitaan|that he may grieve|those who|believe,|but not|he (can) harm them|(in) anything|except|by Allah's permission.||And upon|Allah|let put (their) trust|the believers.
O you who believe |||When|it is said|to you|"Make room,"|in|the assemblies|then make room,|Allah will make room||for you.|And when|it is said|"Rise up,"|then rise up;|Allah will raise||those who|believe|among you|and those who|were given|the knowledge,|(in) degrees.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Aware.
O you who believe |||When|you privately consult|the Messenger,|then offer|before||your private consultation,|charity.|That|(is) better|for you|and purer.|But if|not|you find,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Are you afraid|to|offer|before||your private consultation|charities?|Then when|you do not||and Allah has forgiven||you,|then establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah,|and obey|Allah|and His Messenger.|And Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do.
Do not|you see|[to]|those who|take as allies|a people,|wrath|(of) Allah|(is) upon them?|They (are) not||of you|and not|of them,|and they swear|to|the lie|while they|know.
Allah has prepared||for them|a punishment|severe.|Indeed, [they]|evil is|what|they used to|do.
They have taken|their oaths|(as) a cover,|so they hinder|from|(the) way of Allah,||so for them|(is) a punishment|humiliating.
Never|will avail|them|their wealth|and not|their children|against|Allah|(in) anything.|Those|(will be) companions|(of) the Fire,|they,|in it,|will abide forever.
(On the) Day|Allah will raise them||all,|then they will swear|to Him|as|they swear|to you.|And they think|that they|(are) on|something.|No doubt |Indeed, they|[they]|(are) the liars.
Has overcome|them|the Shaitaan,|so he made them forget|(the) remembrance|(of) Allah.|Those|(are the) party|(of) the Shaitaan.|No doubt |Indeed,|(the) party|(of) the Shaitaan,|they|(will be) the losers.
Indeed,|those who|oppose|Allah|and His Messenger,|those|(will be) among|the most humiliated.
Allah has decreed,||"Surely, I will overcome,|I|and My Messengers."|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Strong,|All-Mighty.
You will not find||a people|who believe|in Allah|and the Day|the Last|loving|(those) who|oppose|Allah|and His Messenger|even if|they were|their fathers|or|their sons|or|their brothers|or|their kindred.|Those -|He has decreed|within|their hearts|faith|and supported them|with a spirit|from Him.|And He will admit them|(to) Gardens,|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers,|will abide forever|in it.|Allah is pleased||with them,|and they are pleased|with Him.|Those|(are the) party|(of) Allah.|No doubt |Indeed,|(the) party|(of) Allah,|they|(are) the successful ones.
Glorifies|[to] Allah|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
He|(is) the One Who|expelled|those who|disbelieved|from|(the) People|(of) the Scripture|from|their homes|at (the) first|gathering.|Not|you think|that|they would leave,|and they thought|that [they]|would defend them|their fortresses|against|Allah.|But Allah came to them||from|where|not|they expected,|and He cast|into|their hearts|[the] terror,|they destroyed|their houses|with their hands|and the hands|(of) the believers.|So take a lesson,|O those endowed with insight |
And if not|[that]|Allah (had) decreed||for them|the exile,|certainly He (would) have punished them|in|the world,|and for them|in|the Hereafter|(is) a punishment|(of) the Fire.
That|(is) because [they]|they opposed|Allah|and His Messenger.|And whoever|opposes|Allah|then indeed,|Allah|(is) severe|(in) penalty.
Whatever|you cut down|of|(the) palm-trees|or|you left them|standing|on|their roots,|it (was) by the permission|(of) Allah,|and that He may disgrace|the defiantly disobedient.
And what|Allah restored||to|His Messenger|from them,|then not|you made expedition|for it|of|horses|and not|camels,|but|Allah|gives power|(to) His Messengers|over|whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
What|Allah restored||to|His Messenger|from|(the) people|(of) the towns,|(it is) for Allah|and His Messenger|and for the kindred||and the orphans|and the needy|and the wayfarer,||that|not|it becomes|a (perpetual) circulation|between|the rich|among you.|And whatever|gives you|the Messenger,|take it|and whatever|he forbids you|from it,|refrain.|And fear|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) severe|(in) penalty.
For the poor|emigrants,|those who|were expelled|from|their homes|and their properties,|seeking|bounty|from Allah||and pleasure|and helping|Allah|and His Messenger.|Those,|they|(are) the truthful.
And those who|settled|(in) the home|and (accepted) faith|before them||love|(those) who|emigrated|to them,|and not|they find|in|their breasts|any want|of what|they were given|but prefer|over|themselves,|even though|was|with  them|poverty.|And whoever|is saved|(from) stinginess|(of) his soul,|then those|[they]|(are) the successful ones.
And those who|came|after them||they say,|"Our Lord,|forgive|us|and our brothers|who|preceded us|in faith,|and (do) not|put|in|our hearts|any rancor|towards those who|believed.|Our Lord,|indeed You|(are) Full of Kindness,|Most Merciful."
Do not|you see|[to]|those who|(were) hypocrites,|saying|to their brothers,|those who|disbelieved,|among|the People of the Scripture,||"If|you are expelled,|surely we will leave|with you,|and not|we will obey|concerning you|anyone,|ever;|and if|you are fought,|certainly we will help you."|And Allah|bears witness|that they|(are) surely liars.
If|they are expelled,|not|they will leave|with them,|and if|they are fought|not|they will help them.|And if|they help them,|certainly they will turn|(their) backs;|then|not|they will be helped.
Certainly you(r)|fear is more intense||in|their breasts|than|Allah's.|That|(is) because they|(are) a people|(who do) not understand.|
They will not fight you||all|except|in|towns|fortified|or|from|behind|walls.|Their violence|among themselves|(is) severe.|You think they|(are) united,|but their hearts|(are) divided.|That|(is) because they|(are) a people,|not|they reason.
Like (the) example|(of) those|before them||shortly,|they tasted|(the) evil result|(of) their affair,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
Like (the) example|(of) the Shaitaan,|when|he says|to man,|"Disbelieve."|But when|he disbelieves,|he says,|"Indeed, I am|disassociated|from you.|Indeed, [I]|I fear|Allah,|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds."
So will be|(the) end of both of them,|that they|(will be) in|the Fire|abiding forever|therein.|And that|(is the) recompense|(of) the wrongdoers.
O you who believe |||Fear|Allah|and let look|every soul|what|it has sent forth|for tomorrow,|and fear|Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do.
And (do) not|be|like those who|forgot|Allah,|so He made them forget|themselves.|Those|[they]|(are) the defiantly disobedient.
Not|equal|(are the) companions,|(of) the Fire|and (the) companions|(of) Paradise.|(The) companions|(of) Paradise|they|(are) the achievers.
If|We (had) sent down|this|Quran|on|a mountain,|surely you (would) have seen it|humbled,|breaking asunder|from|(the) fear|(of) Allah.|And these|(are) the examples,|We present them|to the people|so that they may|give thought.
He|(is) Allah,|the One Who,|(there is) no|god|but|He,|(the) All-Knower|(of) the unseen|and the witnessed.|He|(is) the Most Gracious,|the Most Merciful.
He|(is) Allah,|the One Who,|(there is) no|god|but|He,|the Sovereign,|the Holy One,|the Giver of Peace,|the Giver of Security,|the Guardian,|the All-Mighty,|the Irresistible,|the Supreme.|Glory (be to)|Allah|from what|they associate (with Him).
He|(is) Allah,|the Creator,|the Inventor,|the Fashioner.|For Him|(are) the names|the beautiful.|Glorifies|Him|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
O you who believe |||(Do) not|take|My enemies|and your enemies|(as) allies|offering|them|love|while|they have disbelieved|in what|came to you|of|the truth,|driving out|the Messenger|and yourselves|because|you believe|in Allah,|your Lord.|If|you|come forth|(to) strive|in|My way|and (to) seek|My Pleasure.|You confide|to them|love,|but I Am|most knowing|of what|you conceal|and what|you declare.|And whoever|does it|among you|then certainly|he has strayed|(from the) straight|path.
If|they gain dominance over you,|they would be|to you|enemies|and extend|against you|their hands|and their tongues|with evil,|and they desire|that|you would disbelieve.
Never|will benefit you|your relatives|and not|your children|(on the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|He will judge|between you.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
Indeed,|(there) is|for you|an example|good|in|Ibrahim|and those|with him,|when|they said|to their people,|"Indeed, we|(are) disassociated|from you|and from what|you worship|besides||Allah.|We have denied|you,|and has appeared|between us|and between you|enmity|and hatred|forever|until|you believe|in Allah|Alone."|Except|(the) saying|(of) Ibrahim|to his father,|"Surely I ask forgiveness|for you,|but not|I have power|for you|from|Allah|of|anything.|Our Lord,|upon You|we put our trust,|and to You|we turn,|and to You|(is) the final return.
Our Lord,|(do) not|make us|a trial|for those who|disbelieve,|and forgive|us,|our Lord.|Indeed You|[You]|(are) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise."
Certainly,|(there) is|for you|in them|an example|good|for (he) who|is hopeful||(in) Allah|and the Day|the Last.|And whoever|turns away,|then indeed,|Allah,|He,|(is) Free of need,|the Praiseworthy.
Perhaps|Allah|[that]|will put|between you|and between|those (to) whom|you have been enemies,|among them|love.|And Allah|(is) All-Powerful.|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Allah (does) not forbid you|||from|those who|(do) not|fight you|in|the religion|and (do) not|drive you out|of|your homes|that|you deal kindly|and deal justly|with them.|Indeed,|Allah|loves|those who act justly.
Only|Allah forbids you||from|those who|fight you|in|the religion|and drive you out|of|your homes|and support|in|your expulsion,|that|you make them allies.|And whoever|makes them allies,|then those|[they]|(are) the wrongdoers.
O you who believe |||When|come to you|the believing women|(as) emigrants,|then examine them.|Allah|(is) most knowing|of their faith.|And if|you know them|(to be) believers,|then (do) not|return them|to|the disbelievers.|Not|they|(are) lawful|for them|and not|they|are lawful|for them.|But give them|what|they have spent.|And not|any blame|upon you|if|you marry them|when|you have given them|their (bridal) dues.|And (do) not|hold|to marriage bonds with disbelieving women,||but ask (for)|what|you have spent,|and let them ask|what|they have spent.|That|(is the) Judgment|(of) Allah.|He judges|between you.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing,|All-Wise.
And if|have gone from you|any|of|your wives|to|the disbelievers|then your turn comes,|then give|(to) those who|have gone,|their wives,|(the) like|(of) what|they had spent.|And fear|Allah|(in) Whom,|you,|[in Him]|(are) believers.
O Prophet ||When|come to you|the believing women|pledging to you|[on]|that|not|they will associate|with Allah|anything,|and not|they will steal,|and not|they will commit adultery,|and not|they will kill|their children,|and not|they bring|slander,|they invent it|between|their hands|and their feet,|and not|they will disobey you|in|(the) right,|then accept their pledge|and ask forgiveness|for them|(from) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
O you who believe |||(Do) not|make allies|(of) a people,|Allah's Wrath||(is) upon them.|Indeed,|they despair|of|the Hereafter|as|despair|the disbelievers|of|(the) companions|(of) the graves.
Glorifies|Allah|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
O you who believe |||Why|(do) you say|what|you do not do?|
Great is|hatred|with|Allah|that|you say|what|you do not do?|
Indeed,|Allah|loves|those who|fight|in|His Way|(in) a row|as if they|(were) a structure|joined firmly.
And when|said|Musa|to his people,|"O my people |Why|do you hurt me|while certainly|you know|that I am|(the) Messenger of Allah||to you?"|Then when|they deviated,|Allah caused to deviate||their hearts.|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people,|the defiantly disobedient.
And when|said|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|"O Children of Israel ||Indeed, I am|(the) Messenger of Allah||to you,|confirming|that which|(was) before me||of|the Taurat|and bringer of glad tidings|(of) a Messenger|to come|after me,||whose name (will be)|Ahmad."|But when|he came to them|with clear proofs,|they said,|"This|(is) a magic|clear."
And who|(is) more wrong|than (one) who|invents|upon|Allah|the lie|while he|is invited|to|Islam?|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people|[the] wrongdoers.
They intend|to put out|(the) light|(of) Allah|with their mouths,|but Allah|will perfect|His Light|although|dislike|the disbelievers.
He|(is) the One Who|sent|His Messenger|with guidance|and (the) religion|(of) the truth,|to make it prevail|over|the religion|all of them,|although|dislike (it)|the polytheists.
O you who believe |||Shall|I guide you|to|a transaction|(that) will save you|from|a punishment|painful?
Believe|in Allah|and His Messenger|and strive|in|(the) way|(of) Allah|with your wealth|and your lives.|That|(is) better|for you|if|you|know.
He will forgive|for you|your sins|and admit you|(in) Gardens|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers|and dwellings|pleasant|in|Gardens|(of) Eternity.|That|(is) the success|the great.
And another|that you love -|a help|from|Allah|and a victory|near;|and give glad tidings|(to) the believers.
O you who believe |||Be|helpers|(of) Allah|as|said|Isa,|son|(of) Maryam,|to the disciples,|"Who|(are) my helpers|for|Allah?"|Said|the disciples,|"We|(are) the helpers|(of) Allah."|Then believed|a group|of|Children of Israel||and disbelieved|a group.|So We supported|those who|believed|against|their enemy|and they became|dominant.
Glorifies|Allah|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth,|the Sovereign,|the Holy,|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
He|(is) the One Who|sent|among|the unlettered|a Messenger|from themselves|reciting|to them|His Verses,|and purifying them|and teaching them|the Book|and the wisdom|although|they were|before||surely in|an error|clear.
And others|among them|who have not yet joined||them;|and He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
That|(is the) Bounty of Allah,||He gives it|(to) whom|He wills.|And Allah|(is the) Possessor of Bounty||the Great.
(The) likeness|(of) those who|were entrusted|(with) the Taurat|then|not|they bore it,|(is) like|the donkey|who carries|books.|Wretched is|(the) example|(of) the people|who|deny|(the) Signs|(of) Allah.|And Allah|(does) not|guide|the people,|the wrongdoers.
Say,|"O you who are Jews |||If|you claim|that you|(are) allies|of Allah.|excluding||the people,|then wish|(for) the death,|if|you are|truthful."
But not|they will wish for it,|ever,|for what|(have) sent forth|their hands.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing|of the wrongdoers.
Say,|"Indeed,|the death|which|you flee|from it,|then surely it|(will) meet you.|Then|you will be sent back|to|(the) All-Knower|(of) the unseen|and the witnessed,|and He will inform you|[of] what|you used to|do."
O you who believe |||When|(the) call is made|for (the) prayer|on|(the) day|(of) Friday,|then hasten|to|(the) remembrance|(of) Allah|and leave|the business.|That|(is) better|for you,|if|you|know.
Then when|is concluded|the prayer,|then disperse|in|the land|and seek|from||(the) Bounty of Allah,|and remember|Allah|much|so that you may|succeed.
And when|they saw|a transaction|or|a sport,|they rushed|to it|and left you|standing.|Say,|"What|(is) with|Allah|(is) better|than|the sport|and from|(any) transaction.|And Allah|(is the) Best|(of) the Providers."
When|come to you|the hypocrites,|they say,|"We testify|that you|(are) surely (the) Messenger|(of) Allah."|And Allah|knows|that you|(are) surely His Messenger,|and Allah|testifies|that|the hypocrites|(are) surely liars.
They take|their oaths|(as) a cover,|so they turn away|from|(the) Way|(of) Allah.|Indeed, [they]|evil is|what|they used to|do.
That|(is) because|they believed,|then|they disbelieved;|so were sealed|[upon]|their hearts,|so they|(do) not|understand.
And when|you see them|pleases you|their bodies,|and if|they speak,|you listen|to their speech,|as if they (were)|pieces of wood|propped up.|They think|every|shout|(is) against them.|They|(are) the enemy,|so beware of them.|May Allah destroy them ||How|are they deluded?
And when|it is said|to them,|"Come,|will ask forgiveness|for you|(the) Messenger of Allah."||They turn aside|their heads|and you see them|turning away|while they|(are) arrogant.
(It) is same|for them|whether you ask forgiveness|for them|or|(do) not|ask forgiveness|for them.|Never|will Allah forgive||[to] them.|Indeed,|Allah|(does) not|guide|the people,|the defiantly disobedient.
They|(are) those who|say,|"(Do) not|spend|on|(those) who|(are) with|(the) Messenger|(of) Allah|until|they disband."|And for Allah|(are the) treasures|(of) the heavens|and the earth,|but|the hypocrites|(do) not|understand.
They say,|"If|we return|to|Al-Madinah,|surely, will expel|the more honorable|from it|the more humble."|But for Allah|(is) the honor|and for His Messenger|and for the believers,|but|the hypocrites|(do) not|know.
O you who believe |||(Let) not|divert you|your wealth|and not|your children|from|(the) remembrance|(of) Allah.|And whoever|does|that,|then those|[they]|(are) the losers.
And spend|from|what|We have provided you|before||[that]|comes|(to) one of you|the death|and he says,|"My Lord |Why not|You delay me|for|a term|near|so I would give charity|and be|among|the righteous."
But never|will Allah delay||a soul|when|has come|its term.|And Allah|(is) All-Aware|of what|you do.
Glorifies|[to] Allah|whatever|(is) in|the heavens|and whatever|(is) in|the earth.|For Him|(is the) dominion|and for Him|(is) the praise.|And He|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.
He|(is) the One Who|created you|and among you|(is) a disbeliever|and among you|(is) a believer.|And Allah|of what|you do|(is) All-Seer.
He created|the heavens|and the earth|with truth,|and He formed you|and made good|your forms,|and to Him|(is) the final return.
He knows|what|(is) in|the heavens|and the earth,|and He knows|what|you conceal|and what|you declare.|And Allah|(is) All-Knowing|of what|(is in) the breasts.
Has not|come to you|(the) news|(of) those who|disbelieved|before?||So they tasted|(the bad) consequence|(of) their affair,|and for them|(is) a punishment|painful.
That|(is) because|had|come to them|their Messengers|with clear proofs,|but they said,|"Shall human beings|guide us?"|So they disbelieved|and turned away.|And Allah can do without them.||And Allah|(is) Self-sufficient,|Praiseworthy.
Claim|those who|disbelieve|that|never|will they be raised.|Say,|"Yes,|by my Lord,|surely you will be raised;|then|surely you will be informed|of what|you did.|And that|for|Allah|(is) easy."
So believe|in Allah|and His Messenger|and the Light|which|We have sent down.|And Allah,|of what|you do,|(is) All-Aware.
(The) Day|He will assemble you|for (the) Day|(of) the Assembly,|that|(will be the) Day|(of) mutual loss and gain.|And whoever|believes|in Allah|and does|righteous deeds,|He will remove|from him|his evil deeds,|and He will admit him|(to) Gardens|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers,|abiding|therein|forever.|That|(is) the success|the great.
But those who|disbelieved|and denied|[in] Our Verses,|those|(are the) companions|(of) the Fire,|abiding forever|therein.|And wretched is|the destination.
Not|strikes|any|disaster|except|by (the) permission|(of) Allah.|And whoever|believes|in Allah,|He guides|his heart.|And Allah|of every|thing|(is) All-Knowing.
So obey|Allah|and obey|the Messenger;|but if|you turn away,|then only|upon|Our Messenger|(is) the conveyance|clear.
Allah,|(there is) no|god|except|Him.|And upon|Allah|let put (their) trust|the believers.
O you who believe |||Indeed,|from|your spouses|and your children|(are) enemies|to you,|so beware of them.|But if|you pardon|and overlook|and forgive,|then indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Only|your wealth|and your children|(are) a trial,|and Allah -|with Him|(is) a reward|great.
So fear|Allah|what|you are able|and listen|and obey|and spend;|(it is) better|for yourselves.|And whoever|is saved|(from the) greediness|(of) his soul,|then those|[they]|(are) the successful ones.
If|you loan|(to) Allah|a loan|goodly,|He will multiply it|for you|and will forgive|you.|And Allah|(is) Most Appreciative,|Most Forbearing,
(The) Knower|(of) the unseen|and the witnessed,|the All-Mighty,|the All-Wise.
O Prophet ||When|you divorce|[the]  women,|then divorce them|for their waiting period,|and keep count|(of) the waiting period,|and fear|Allah,|your Lord.|(Do) not|expel them|from|their houses,|and not|they should leave|except|that|they commit|an immorality|clear.|And these|(are the) limits|(of) Allah.|And whoever|transgresses|(the) limits|(of) Allah|then certainly|he has wronged|himself.|Not|you know;|Perhaps|Allah|will bring about,|after|that,|a matter.
Then when|they have reached|their term,|then retain them|with kindness|or|part with them|with kindness.|And take witness|two men|just|among you|and establish|the testimony|for Allah.|That|is instructed,|with it,|whoever|[is]|believes|in Allah|and the Day|the Last.|And whoever|fears Allah,||He will make|for him|a way out,
And He will provide for him|from|where|not|he thinks.|And whoever|puts his trust|upon|Allah,|then He|(is) sufficient for him.|Indeed,|Allah|(will) accomplish|His purpose.|Indeed,|Allah has set||for every|thing|a measure.
And those who|have despaired|of|the menstruation|among|your women,|if|you doubt,|then their waiting period|(is) three|months,|and the ones who|not|[they] menstruated.|And those who (are) pregnant,||their term (is)|until|they deliver|their burdens.|And whoever|fears|Allah,|He will make|for him|of|his affair|ease.
That|(is the) Command of Allah,||which He has sent down|to you;|and whoever|fears Allah,||He will remove|from him|his evil deeds|and make great|for him|(his) reward.
Lodge them|[from] where||you dwell,|(out) of|your means|and (do) not|harm them|to distress|[on] them.|And if|they are|pregnant,||then spend|on them|until|they deliver|their burden.|Then if|they suckle|for you,|then give them|their payment,|and consult|among yourselves|with kindness,|but if|you disagree,|then may suckle|for him|another (women).
Let spend|owner of ample means||from|his ample means,|and (he) who,|is restricted|on him|his provision,|let him spend|from what|Allah has given him.||Allah does not burden|||any soul|except|(with) what|He has given it.|Allah will bring about||after|hardship|ease.
And how many|of|a town|rebelled|against|(the) Command|(of) its Lord|and His Messengers,|so We took it to account,|an account|severe;|and We punished it,|a punishment|terrible.
So it tasted|(the bad) consequence|(of) its affair,|and was|(the) end|(of) its affair|loss.
Allah has prepared||for them|a punishment|severe.|So fear Allah,||O men of understanding,||those who|have believed |Indeed,|Allah has sent down||to you|a Message.
A Messenger|reciting|to you|(the) Verses|(of) Allah|clear,|that he may bring out|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|from|the darkness[es]|towards|the light.|And whoever|believes|in Allah|and does|righteous deeds,|He will admit him|(into) Gardens|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers,|abiding|therein|forever.|Indeed,|Allah has (granted) good||provision for him.|
Allah|(is) He Who|created|seven|heavens|and of|the earth,|(the) like of them.|Descends|the command|between them|that you may know|that|Allah|(is) on|every|thing|All-Powerful.|And that,|Allah|indeed,|encompasses|all|things|(in) knowledge.
O Prophet ||Why (do)|you prohibit|what|Allah has made lawful||for you,|seeking|(to) please|your wives?|And Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
Indeed,|Allah has ordained||for you|(the) dissolution|(of) your oaths.|And Allah|(is) your Protector|and He|(is) the All-Knower,|the All-Wise.
And when|confided|the Prophet|to|one|(of) his wives|a statement,|and when|she informed|about it|and Allah made it apparent||to him,|he made known|a part of it|and avoided|[of]|a part.|Then when|he informed her|about it,|she said,|"Who|informed you|this?"|He said,|"Has informed me|the All-Knower|the All-Aware."
If|you both turn|to|Allah,|so indeed,|(are) inclined|your hearts;|but if|you backup each other|against him,|then indeed,|Allah,|He|(is) his Protector,|and Jibreel,|and (the) righteous|believers,|and the Angels,|after|that|(are his) assistants.
Perhaps|his Lord,|if|he divorced you,|[that]|He will substitute for him|wives|better|than you|submissive,|faithful,|obedient,|repentant,|who worship,|who fast,|previously married|and virgins.
O you who believe |||Protect|yourselves|and your families|(from) a Fire|whose fuel|(is) people|and stones,|over it|(are) Angels|stern,|severe;|not|they disobey|Allah|(in) what|He Commands them|but they do|what|they are commanded.
"O you who disbelieve |||(Do) not|make excuses|today.|Only|you will be recompensed|(for) what|you used (to)|do."
O you who believe |||Turn|to|Allah|(in) repentance|sincere |Perhaps|your Lord|[that]|will remove|from you|your evil deeds|and admit you|(into) Gardens|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers,|(on the) Day|not|Allah will disgrace||the Prophet|and those who|believed|with him.|Their light|will run|before them||and on their right;|they will say,|"Our Lord|Perfect|for us|our light|and grant forgiveness|to us.|Indeed, You|(are) over|every|thing|All-Powerful."
O Prophet ||Strive|(against) the disbelievers|and the hypocrites,|and be stern|with them.|And their abode|(is) Hell,|and wretched is|the destination.
Allah presents||an example|for those who|disbelieved -|(the) wife|(of) Nuh|(and the) wife|(of) Lut.|They were|under|two [slaves]|of|Our slaves|righteous,|but they both betrayed them,|so not|they availed,|both of them,|from|Allah|(in) anything,|and it was said,|"Enter|the Fire|with|those who enter."
And Allah presents||an example|for those who|believed -|(the) wife|(of) Firaun,|when|she said,|"My Lord |Build|for me|near You|a house|in|Paradise,|and save me|from|Firaun|and his deeds|and save me|from|the people|the wrongdoers."
And Maryam,|(the) daughter|(of) Imran|who|guarded|her chastity,|so We breathed|into it|of|Our Spirit.|And she believed|(in the) Words|(of) her Lord|and His Books,|and she was|of|the devoutly obedient.
Blessed is|He|in Whose Hand|(is) the Dominion,|and He|(is) over|every|thing|All-Powerful.
The One Who|created|death|and life|that He may test you,|which of you|(is) best|(in) deed.|And He|(is) the All-Mighty,|the Oft-Forgiving.
The One Who|created|seven|heavens|one above another.|Not|you see|in|(the) creation|(of) the Most Gracious|any|fault.|So return|the vision,|can|you see|any|flaw?
Then|return|the vision|twice (again).|Will return|to you|the vision|humbled|while it|(is) fatigued.
And certainly|We have beautified|the nearest heaven||with lamps,|and We have made them|(as) missiles|for the devils,|and We have prepared|for them|punishment|(of) the Blaze.
And for those who|disbelieved|in their Lord|(is the) punishment|(of) Hell,|and wretched is|the destination.
When|they are thrown|therein,|they will hear|from it|an inhaling|while it|boils up.
It almost|bursts|from|rage.|Every time|is thrown|therein|a group,|(will) ask them|its keepers,|"Did not|come to you|a warner?"
They will say,|"Yes,|indeed|came to us|a warner,|but we denied|and we said,|'Not|has Allah sent down||any|thing.|Not|you (are)|but|in|error|great.'"
And they will say,|"If|we had|listened|or|reasoned,|not|we (would) have been|among|(the) companions|(of) the Blaze."
Then they (will) confess|their sins,|so away with|(the) companions|(of) the Blaze.
Indeed,|those who|fear|their Lord|unseen,|for them|(is) forgiveness|and a reward|great.
And conceal|your speech|or|proclaim|it.|Indeed, He|(is the) All-Knower|of what (is in)|the breasts.
Does He not know,||(the One) Who|created?|And He|(is) the Subtle,|the All-Aware.
He|(is) the One Who|made|for you|the earth|subservient,|so walk|in|(the) paths thereof|and eat|of|His provision,|and to Him|(is) the Resurrection.
Do you feel secure|(from Him) Who|(is) in|the heaven|not|He will cause to swallow|you|the earth|when|it|sways?
Or|do you feel secure|(from Him) Who|(is) in|the heaven,|that|He will send|against you|a storm of stones?|Then you would know|how|(was) My warning?
And indeed,|denied|those|before them,||and how|was|My rejection.
Do not|they see|[to]|the birds|above them|spreading (their wings)|and folding?|Not|holds them|except|the Most Gracious.|Indeed, He|(is) of every|thing|All-Seer.
Who is|this,|the one,|he|(is) an army|for you|to help you||besides|the Most Gracious?|Not|(are) the disbelievers|but|in|delusion.
Who is|this,|the one,|to provide you|if|He withheld|His provision?|Nay,|they persist|in|pride|and aversion.
Then is he who|walks|fallen|on|his face|better guided,|or (he) who|walks|upright|on|(the) Path|Straight?
Say,|"He|(is) the One Who|produced you|and made|for you|the hearing,|and the vision|and the feelings.|Little|(is) what|you give thanks."
Say,|"He|(is) the One Who|multiplied you|in|the earth|and to Him|you will be gathered."
And they say,|"When|(is) this|promise,|if|you are|truthful?"
Say,|"Only|the knowledge|(is) with|Allah,|and only|I am|a warner|clear."
But when|they (will) see it|approaching,|(will be) distressed|(the) faces|(of) those who|disbelieved,|and it will be said,|"This|(is) that which|you used to|for it|call."
Say,|"Have you seen,|if|Allah destroys me||and whoever|(is) with me|or|has mercy upon us,|then who|(can) protect|the disbelievers|from|a punishment|painful."
Say,|"He|(is) the Most Gracious;|we believe|in Him,|and upon Him|we put (our) trust.|So you will know|who|(is) it|(that is) in|error|clear."
Say,|"Have you seen,|if|becomes|your water|sunken,|then who|could bring you|water|flowing?"
Nun.|By the pen|and what|they write,
Not|you (are),|by (the) Grace|(of) your Lord,|a madman.
And indeed,|for you|surely (is) a reward|endless.|
And indeed, you|surely (are)|(of) a moral character|great.
So you will see|and they will see,
Which of you|(is) the afflicted one.
Indeed,|your Lord,|He|(is) most knowing|of (he) who|has strayed|from|His way,|and He|(is) most knowing|of the guided ones.
So (do) not|obey|the deniers.
They wish|that|you should compromise,|so they would compromise.
And (do) not|obey|every|habitual swearer|worthless,
Defamer|going about|with malicious gossip,
A preventer,|of (the) good,|transgressor,|sinful,
Cruel,|after|(all) that|utterly useless.
Because|(he) is|a possessor of wealth||and children,
When|are recited|to him|Our Verses,|he says,|"Stories|(of) the former (people)."
We will brand him|on|the snout.
Indeed, We|have tried them|as|We tried|((the) companions|(of) the garden,|when|they swore|to pluck its fruit|(in the) morning,
And not|making exception.
So there came|upon it|a visitation|from|your Lord,|while they|were asleep.
So it became|as if reaped.
And they called one another|(at) morning,
That|"Go early|to|your crop|if|you would|pluck (the) fruit."
So they went,|while they|lowered (their) voices,
That|"Not|will enter it|today|upon you|any poor person."
And they went early|with|determination|able.
But when|they saw it,|they said,|"Indeed, we|(are) surely lost.
Nay |We|(are) deprived."
Said|(the) most moderate of them,|"Did not|I tell|you,|'Why not|you glorify (Allah)?'"
They said,|"Glory be|(to) our Lord |Indeed, we|[we] were|wrongdoers."
Then approached,|some of them|to others||blaming each other.
They said,|"O woe to us |Indeed, we|[we] were|transgressors.
Perhaps,|our Lord,|[that]|will substitute for us|a better|than it.|Indeed, we|to|our Lord|turn devoutly."
Such|(is) the punishment.|And surely the punishment|(of) the Hereafter|(is) greater,|if|they|know.
Indeed,|for the righteous|with|their Lord|(are) Gardens|(of) Delight.
Then will We treat|the Muslims|like the criminals?
What|(is) for you?|How|(do) you judge?
Or|(is) for you|a book|wherein|you learn,
Indeed,|for you|in it|what|you choose?
Or|for you|oaths|from us,|reaching|to|(the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.|indeed,|for you|(is) what|you judge?
Ask them,|which of them|for that|(is) responsible.
Or|(are) for them|partners?|Then let them bring|their partners,|if|they are|truthful.
(The) Day|will be uncovered|from|the shin|and they will be called|to|prostrate,|but not|they will be able,
Humbled,|their eyes,|will cover them|humiliation.|And indeed,|they were|called|to|prostrate|while they|(were) sound.
So leave Me|and whoever|denies|this|Statement,|We will progressively lead them|from|where|not|they know.
And I will give respite|to them.|Indeed,|My plan|(is) firm.
Or|you ask them|a payment,|so they|from|(the) debt|(are) burdened?
Or|(is) with them|the unseen,|so they|write it?
So be patient|for (the) decision|(of) your Lord,|and (do) not|be|like (the) companion|(of) the fish,|when|he called out,|while he|(was) distressed.
If not|that|overtook him|a Favor|from|his Lord,|surely he would have been thrown|onto (the) naked shore|while he|(was) blamed.
But chose him,|his Lord,|and made him|of|the righteous.
And indeed,|would almost|those who|disbelieve,|surely make you slip|with their looks|when|they hear|the Message,|and they say,|"Indeed, he|(is) surely mad."
And not|it (is)|but|a Reminder|to the worlds.
The Inevitable Reality 
What|(is) the Inevitable Reality?
And what|will make you know|what|(is) the Inevitable Reality?
Denied|Thamud|and Aad|the Striking Calamity.
So as for|Thamud,|they were destroyed|by the overpowering (blast).
And as for|Aad,|they were destroyed|by a wind|screaming|violent,
Which He imposed|upon them|(for) seven|nights|and eight|days|(in) succession,|so you would see|the people|therein|fallen|as if they were|trunks|(of) date-palms|hollow.
Then do|you see|of them|any|remains?
And came|Firaun,|and (those) before him,||and the overturned cities|with sin.
And they disobeyed|(the) Messenger|(of) their Lord,|so He seized them|(with) a seizure|exceeding.
Indeed, We|when|overflowed|the water,|We carried you|in|the sailing (ship).
That We might make it|for you|a reminder|and would be conscious of it|an ear|conscious.
Then when|is blown|in|the trumpet -|a blast|single,
And are lifted|the earth|and the mountains|and crushed|(with) a crushing|single.
Then (on) that Day|will occur|the Occurrence,
And will split|the heaven,|so it|(is on) that Day|frail.
And the Angels|(will be) on|its edges,|and will bear|(the) Throne|(of) your Lord|above them,|that Day,|eight.
That Day,|you will be exhibited,|not|will be hidden|among you|any secret.
Then as for|(him) who|is given|his record|in his right hand|will say,|"Here,|read|my record 
Indeed, I|was certain|that I|(will) meet|my account."
So he|(will be) in|a life|pleasant,
In|a Garden|elevated,
Its clusters of fruits|hanging near.
"Eat|and drink|(in) satisfaction|for what|you sent before you|in|the days|past."
But as for|(him) who|is given|his record|in his left hand|will say,|"O  I wish|not|I had been given|my record
And not|I had known|what|(is) my account.
O  I wish it|had been|the end
Not|has availed|me|my wealth,
Is gone|from me|my authority."
"Seize him|and shackle him,
Then|(into) the Hellfire|burn him.
Then|into|a chain,|its length|(is) seventy|cubits,|insert him."
Indeed, he|(did) not||believe|in Allah|the Most Great,
And (did) not|feel the urge|on|(the) feeding|(of) the poor.
So not|for him|today|here|any devoted friend,
And not|any food|except|from|(the) discharge of wounds,
Not|will eat it|except|the sinners.
But nay |I swear|by what|you see,
And what|not|you see,
Indeed, it (is)|surely (the) Word|(of) a Messenger|noble.
And not|it|(is the) word|(of) a poet;|little|(is) what|you believe 
And not|(it is the) word|(of) a soothsayer;|little|(is) what|you take heed.
(It is) a revelation|from|(the) Lord|(of) the worlds.
And if|he (had) fabricated|against Us|some|sayings,
Certainly We (would) have seized|him|by the right hand;
Then|certainly We (would) have cut off|from him|the aorta.
And not|from you|any|one|[from him]|(who could) prevent (it).
And indeed, it|(is) surely a reminder|for the Allah-fearing.
And indeed, We|surely know|that|among you|(are) deniers.
And indeed, it|(is) surely a regret|upon|the disbelievers.
And indeed, it (is)|surely (the) truth|(of) certainty.
So glorify|(the) name|(of) your Lord,|the Most Great.
Asked|a questioner|about a punishment|bound to happen
To the disbelievers,|not|of it|any preventer.
From Allah,||Owner of the ways of ascent.|
Ascend|the Angels|and the Spirit|to Him|in|a Day,|[is]|its measure|(is) fifty|thousand|year(s).
So be patient,|a patience|good.
Indeed, they|see it|(as) far off.
But We see it|near.
(The) Day -|will be|the sky|like molten copper,
And will be|the mountains|like wool,
And not|will ask|a friend|(about) a friend.
They will be made to see each other.|Would wish|the criminal|if|he (could be) ransomed|from|(the) punishment|(of) that Day|by his children,
And his spouse|and his brother,
And his nearest kindred|who|sheltered him,
And whoever|(is) on|the earth|all,|then|it (could) save him.
By no means |Indeed, it (is)|surely a Flame of Hell,
A remover|of the skin of the head,
Inviting|(him) who|turned his back|and went away
And collected|and hoarded.
Indeed,|the man|was created|anxious -
When|touches him|the evil,|distressed.
And when|touches him|the good,|withholding,
Except|those who pray -
Those who|[they]|at|their prayer|(are) constant,
And those who|in|their wealth|(is) a right|known,
For the one who asks|and the deprived,
And those who|accept (the) truth|(of the) Day|(of) the Judgment,
And those who|[they]|of|(the) punishment|(of) their Lord|(are) fearful -
Indeed,|(the) punishment|(of) your Lord|(is) not|to be felt secure (of) -
And those who|[they]|their modesty|(are) guardians,
Except|from|their spouses|or|what|they rightfully possess||then indeed, they|(are) not|blameworthy,
But whoever|seeks|beyond|that,|then those|[they]|(are) the transgressors -
And those who|[they]|of their trusts|and their promise|(are) observers,
And those who|[they]|in their testimonies|stand firm,
And those who,|[they]|on|their prayer|keep a guard -
Those|(will be) in|Gardens,|honored.
So what is with|those who|disbelieve,|before you|(they) hasten,
On|the right|and on|the left,|(in) separate groups?
Does long|every|person,|among them|that|he enters|a Garden|(of) Delight?
By no means |Indeed, We|[We] have created them|from what|they know.
But nay |I swear|by (the) Lord|(of) the risings|and the settings,|that We|(are) surely Able
[On]|to|[We] replace|(with) better|than them;|and not|We|(are) to be outrun.
So leave them|(to) converse vainly|and amuse themselves|until|they meet|their Day,|which|they are promised,
(The) Day|they will come out|from|the graves|rapidly|as if they (were)|to|a goal|hastening,
Humbled|their eyesights,|will cover them|humiliation.|That|(is) the Day|which|they were|promised.
Indeed, We|[We] sent|Nuh|to|his people,|that|"Warn|your people|before||[that]|comes to them|a punishment|painful."
He said,|"O my people |Indeed, I am|to you|a warner|clear.
That|Worship|Allah,|and fear Him|and obey me.
He will forgive|for you|[of]|your sins|and give you respite|for|a term|specified.|Indeed,|(the) term,|(of) Allah,|when|it comes|not|is delayed,|if|you|know."
He said,|"My Lord |Indeed, I|invited|my people|night|and day.
But not|increased them|my invitation|except|(in) flight.
And indeed, I|every time,|I invited them|that You may forgive|them,|they put|their fingers|in|their ears|and covered themselves|(with) their garments|and persisted|and were arrogant|(with) pride.
Then|indeed, I|invited them|publicly.
Then|indeed, I|announced|to them|and I confided|to them|secretly,
Then I said,|'Ask forgiveness|(from) your Lord.|Indeed, He|is|Oft-Forgiving.
He will send down|(rain from) the sky|upon you|(in) abundance,
And provide you|with wealth|and children,|and make|for you|gardens|and make|for you|rivers.
What|(is) for you,|not|you attribute|to Allah|grandeur?
And indeed,|He created you|(in) stages.
Do not|you see|how|Allah has created||(the) seven|heavens|(in) layers,
And made|the moon|therein|a light|and made|the sun|a lamp?
And Allah|has caused you to grow|from|the earth|(as) a growth.
Then|He will return you|into it|and bring you forth,|(a new) bringing forth.
And Allah|made|for you|the earth|an expanse,
That you may go along|therein|(in) paths|wide.'"
Said|Nuh,|"My Lord |Indeed, they|disobeyed me|and followed|(the one) who,|(did) not|increase him|his wealth,|and his children|except|(in) loss.
And they have planned,|a plan|great.
And they said,|'(Do) not|leave|your gods,|and (do) not|leave|Wadd|and not|Suwa|and not|Yaguth|and Yauq|and Nasr.'
And indeed,|they have led astray|many.|And not|increase|the wrongdoers|except|(in) error."
Because of|their sins|they were drowned,|then made to enter|(the) Fire,|and not|they found|for themselves||besides|Allah|any helpers.
And said|Nuh,|"My Lord |(Do) not|leave|on|the earth|any|(of) the disbelievers|(as) an inhabitant.
Indeed, You,|if|You leave them|they will mislead|Your slaves|and not|they will beget|except|a wicked,|a disbeliever.
My Lord |Forgive|me|and my parents,|and whoever|enters|my house -|a believer|and the believing men|and the believing women.|And (do) not|increase|the wrongdoers|except|(in) destruction."
Say,|"It has been revealed|to me|that|listened|a group|of|the jinn,|and they said,|'Indeed, we|heard|a Quran|amazing,
It guides|to|the right way,|so we believe|in it,|and never|we will associate|with our Lord|anyone.
And that He -|Exalted is|(the) Majesty|(of) our Lord -|not|He has taken|a wife|and not|a son,
And that he|used to|speak -|the foolish among us|against|Allah|an excessive transgression.
And that we|thought|that|never|will say|the men|and the jinn,|against|Allah|any lie.
And that|(there) were|men|among|mankind|who sought refuge|in (the) men|from|the jinn,|so they increased them|(in) burden.
And that they|thought|as|you thought|that|never|will Allah raise||anyone.
And that we|sought to touch|the heaven|but we found it|filled (with)|guards|severe,|and flaming fires.
And that we|used to|sit|there in|positions|for hearing,|but (he) who|listens|now|will find|for him|a flaming fire|waiting.
And that we -|not|we know|whether evil|is intended|for (those) who|(are) in|the earth|or|intends|for them|their Lord|a right path.
And that [We]|among us|(are) the righteous|and among us|(are) other than that.||We|(are on) ways|different.
And that we|[we] have become certain|that|never|we will cause failure to Allah||in|the earth|and never|we can escape Him|(by) flight.
And that [We]|when|we heard|the Guidance|we believed|in it.|And whoever|believes|in his Lord,|then not|he will fear|any loss|and not|any burden.
And that we,|among us|(are) Muslims|and among us|(are) unjust.|And whoever|submits,|then those|have sought|(the) right path.
And as for|the unjust,|they will be,|for Hell,|firewood.'"
And that if|they had remained|on|the Way,|surely We (would) have given them to drink|water|(in) abundance,
That We might test them|therein.|And whoever|turns away|from|the Remembrance|(of) his Lord,|He will make him enter|a punishment|severe.
And that|the masajid|(are) for Allah,|so (do) not|call|with|Allah|anyone.
And that|when|stood up|(the) slave|(of) Allah|calling (upon) Him,|they almost|became|around him|a compacted mass.
Say,|"Only|I call upon|my Lord,|and not|I associate|with Him|anyone."
Say,|"Indeed, I|(do) not|possess|for you|any harm|and not|right path."
Say,|"Indeed I,|never|can protect me|from|Allah|anyone,|and never|can I find|besides Him||any refuge.
But|(the) notification|from|Allah|and His Messages."|And whoever|disobeys|Allah|and His Messenger,|then indeed,|for him|(is the) Fire|(of) Hell,|(they will) abide|therein|forever.
Until,|when|they see|what|they are promised,|then they will know|who|(is) weaker|(in) helpers|and fewer|(in) number.
Say,|"Not|I know|whether is near|what|you are promised|or (whether)|will appoint|for it|my Lord|a (distant) term.
(The) All-Knower|(of) the unseen,|so not|He reveals||His unseen|(to) anyone,
Except|whom|He has approved|of|a Messenger,|and indeed, He|makes to march|[from]|before him||and from|behind him|a guard,
That He may make evident|that|indeed,|they have conveyed|(the) Messages|(of) their Lord;|and He has encompassed|what|(is) with them|and He takes account|(of) all|things|(in) number."
O you|who wraps himself 
Stand|(in) the night,|except|a little,
Half of it,|or|lessen|from it|a little,
Or|add|to it,|and recite|the Quran|(with) measured rhythmic recitation.
Indeed, We|will cast|upon you|a Word|heavy.
Indeed,|(the) rising|(at) the night,|it|(is) very hard|and most potent|and more suitable|(for) Word.
Indeed,|for you|in|the day|(is) occupation|prolonged.
And remember|(the) name|(of) your Lord|and devote yourself|to Him|(with) devotion.
(The) Lord|(of) the east|and the west;|(there is) no|god|except|Him,|so take Him|(as) Disposer of Affairs.
And be patient|over|what|they say,|and avoid them,|an avoidance|gracious.
And leave Me|and the deniers,|possessors|(of) the ease,|and allow them respite -|a little.
Indeed,|with Us|(are) shackles|and burning fire,
And food|that chokes||and a punishment|painful.
(On the) Day|will quake|the earth|and the mountains,|and will become|the mountains|a heap of sand|pouring down.
Indeed, We|[We] have sent|to you|a Messenger|(as) a witness|upon you,|as|We sent|to|Firaun|a Messenger.
But disobeyed|Firaun|the Messenger,|so We seized him|(with) a seizure|ruinous.
Then how|will you guard yourselves,|if|you disbelieve,|a Day|(that) will make|the children|gray-haired?
The heaven|(will) break apart|therefrom,|is|His Promise|to be fulfilled.
Indeed,|this|(is) a Reminder,|then whoever|wills|(let him) take|to|his Lord|a way.
Indeed,|your Lord|knows|that you|stand|(a little) less|than|two-thirds|(of) the night,|and half of it|and a third of it|and (so do) a group|of|those who|(are) with you.|And Allah|determines|the night|and the day.|He knows|that|not|you count it,|so He has turned|to you,|so recite|what|is easy|of|the Quran.|He knows|that|there will be|among you|sick|and others|traveling|in|the land|seeking|of|(the) Bounty|(of) Allah,|and others|fighting|in|(the) way|(of) Allah.|So recite|what|is easy|of it,|and establish|the prayer|and give|the zakah|and loan|Allah|a loan|goodly.|And whatever|you send forth|for yourselves|of|good,|you will find it|with|Allah.|It|(will be) better|and greater|(in) reward.|And seek forgiveness|(of) Allah.|Indeed,|Allah|(is) Oft-Forgiving,|Most Merciful.
O you|who covers himself 
Stand up|and warn,
And your Lord|magnify,
And your clothing|purify,
And uncleanliness|avoid,
And (do) not|confer favor|(to) acquire more,
And for your Lord|be patient.
Then when|is blown|in|the trumpet,
That|Day,|(will be) a Day|difficult,
For|the disbelievers -|not|easy.
Leave Me|and whom|I created|alone,
And I granted|to him|wealth|extensive,
And children|present,
And I spread|for him,|ease.
Then|he desires|that|I (should) add more.
By no means |Indeed, he|has been|to Our Verses|stubborn.
Soon I will cover Him|(with) a laborious punishment.
Indeed, he|thought|and plotted.
So may he be destroyed,|how|he plotted 
Then|may he be destroyed,|how|he plotted 
Then|he looked;
Then|he frowned|and scowled;
Then|he turned back|and was proud,
Then he said,|"Not|(is) this|but|magic|imitated.
Not|(is) this|but|(the) word|(of) a human being."
Soon I will drive him|(into) Hell.
And what|can make you know|what|(is) Hell?
Not|it lets remain|and not|it leaves,
Scorching|the human (skin).
Over it|(are) nineteen.|
And not|We have made|keepers|(of) the Fire|except|Angels.|And not|We have made|their number|except|(as) a trial|for those who|disbelieve -|that may be certain|those who|were given|the Scripture|and may increase|those who|believe|(in) faith,|and not|may doubt|those who|were given|the Scripture|and the believers,|and that may say|those|in|their hearts|(is) a disease|and the disbelievers|"What|(does) Allah intend||by this|example?"|Thus|Allah lets go astray||whom|He wills|and guides|whom|He wills.|And none|knows|(the) hosts|(of) your Lord|except|Him.|And not|it|(is) but|a reminder|to (the) human beings.
Nay |By the moon,
And the night|when|it departs,
And the morning|when|it brightens,
Indeed, it|(is) surely one|(of) the greatest,
A warning|to (the) human being,
To whoever|wills|among you|to|proceed|or|stay behind.
Every|soul,|for what|it has earned,|(is) pledged,
Except|(the) companions|(of) the right,
In|Gardens,|asking each other,
About|the criminals,
"What|led you|into|Hell?"
They will say,|"Not|we were|of|those who prayed,
And not|we used to|feed|the poor,
And we used to|indulge in vain talk|with|the vain talkers,
And we used to|deny|(the) Day|(of) the Judgment,
Until,|came to us|the certainty."
Then not|will benefit them|intercession|(of) the intercessors.
Then what|(is) for them,|(that) from|the Reminder|they (are) turning away
As if they (were)|donkeys|frightened,
Fleeing|from|a lion?
Nay |Desires|every|person|of them|that|he may be given|pages|spread out.
Nay |But|not|they fear|the Hereafter.
Nay |Indeed, it|(is) a Reminder.
So whoever|wills,|(may) pay heed to it.
And not|will pay heed|except|that|Allah wills.||He|(is) worthy|to be feared,|and worthy|to forgive.
Nay |I swear|by (the) Day|(of) the Resurrection.
And nay |I swear|by the soul|self-accusing.
Does think|[the] man|that not|We will assemble|his bones?
Nay |(We are) Able|on|that|We can restore|his fingertips.
Nay |Desires|[the] man|to give (the) lie|(to) what is before him.
He asks,|"When|(is the) Day|(of) the Resurrection?"
So when|is dazzled|the vision,
And becomes dark|the moon,
And are joined|the sun|and the moon,
Will say|[the] man|that Day,|"Where|(is) the escape?"
By no means |(There is) no|refuge.
To|your Lord,|that Day,|(is) the place of rest.
Will be informed|[the] man|that Day|of what|he sent forth|and kept back.
Nay |[The] man|against|himself|(will be) a witness.
Even if|he presents|his excuses.
Not|move|with it|your tongue|to hasten|with it.
Indeed,|upon Us|(is) its collection|and its recitation.
And when|We have recited it,|then follow|its recitation.
Then|indeed,|upon Us|(is) its explanation.
No |But|you love|the immediate,
And leave|the Hereafter.
Faces|that Day|(will be) radiant,
Towards|their Lord|looking,
And faces|that Day|(will be) distorted,
Thinking|that|will be done|to them|backbreaking.
No |When|it reaches|the collar bones
And it is said,|"Who|(will) cure?"
And he is certain|that it|(is) the parting.
And is wound,|the leg|about the leg,
To|your Lord|that Day|(will be) the driving.
And not|he accepted (the) truth|and not|he prayed.
But|he denied|and turned away.
Then|he went|to|his family,|swaggering.
Woe|to you,|and woe 
Then|woe|to you,|and woe 
Does think|man|that|he will be left|neglected?
Was not|he|a semen-drop|of|semen|emitted?
Then|he was|a clinging substance,|then He created|and proportioned.
Then made|of him|two kinds,|(the) male|and the female.
Is not|[that]|(He) Able|[over]|to|give life|(to) the dead?
Has|(there) come|upon|man|a period|of|time|not|he was|a thing|mentioned?
Indeed, We|[We] created|man|from|a semen-drop|a mixture|(that) We test him;|so We made (for) him|hearing|and sight.
Indeed, We|guided him|(to) the way|whether|(he) be grateful|and whether|(he) be ungrateful.
Indeed, We|[We] have prepared|for the disbelievers|chains|and shackles|and a Blazing Fire.
Indeed,|the righteous|will drink|from|a cup,|is|its mixture|(of) Kafur,
A spring -|will drink|from it|(the) slaves of Allah;||causing it to gush forth|abundantly.
They fulfill|the vows|and fear|a Day -|its evil is||widespread.
And they feed|the food|in spite of|love (for) it,|(to the) needy,|and (the) orphan|and (the) captive,
"Only|we feed you|for (the) Countenance|(of) Allah.|Not|we desire|from you|any reward|and not|thanks.
Indeed, we|fear|from|our Lord|a Day -|harsh|and distressful."
But Allah will protect them||(from the) evil|(of) that|Day|and will cause them to meet|radiance|and happiness.
And will reward them|because|they were patient,|(with) a Garden|and silk.
Reclining|therein|on|couches.|Not|they will see|therein|sun|and not|freezing cold.
And near|above them|(are) its shades|and will hang low|its cluster of fruits|dangling low.
And will be circulated|among them|vessels|of|silver|and cups|(that) are|(of) crystal.
Crystal-clear|of|silver.|They will determine its|measure.
And they will be given to drink|therein|a cup -|is|its mixture|(of) Zanjabil,
A spring|therein,|named|Salsabil.
And will circulate|among them|young boys|made eternal.|When|you see them,|you would think them|(to be) pearls|scattered.
And when|you look,|then|you will see|blessings|and a kingdom|great.
Upon them|(will be) garments|(of) fine silk|green|and heavy brocade.|And they will be adorned|(with) bracelets|of|silver,|and their Lord will give them to drink,||a drink|pure.
"Indeed,|this|is|for you|a reward,|and has been|your effort|appreciated."
Indeed, We|[We]|[We] revealed|to you|the Quran|progressively.
So be patient|for (the) Command|(of) your Lord|and (do) not|obey|from them|any sinner|or|disbeliever.
And remember|(the) name|(of) your Lord|morning|and evening.
And of|the night|prostrate|to Him,|and glorify Him|a night|long.
Indeed,|these|love|the immediate,|and leave|behind them|a Day|grave.
We,|created them|and We strengthened|their forms,|and when|We will,|We can change|their likeness[es]|(with) a change.
Indeed,|this|(is) a reminder,|so whoever|wills,|let him take|to|his Lord|a way.
And not|you will|except|that|Allah wills.||Indeed,|Allah|is|All-Knower,|All-Wise.
He admits|whom|He wills|into|His mercy,|but (for) the wrongdoers,|He has prepared|for them|a punishment|painful.
By the ones sent forth,|one after another,
And the winds that blow|violently,
And the ones that scatter|far and wide,
And those who separate|(by the) Criterion,
And those who bring down|(the) Reminder,
(As) justification|or|warning,
Indeed, what|you are promised|will surely occur.
So when|the stars|are obliterated,
And when|the heaven|is cleft asunder,
And when|the mountains|are blown away,
And when|the Messengers|are gathered to their appointed time.
For what|Day|are (these) postponed?
For (the) Day|(of) Judgment.
And what|will make you know|what|(is the) Day|(of) the Judgment?
Woe|that Day|to the deniers
Did not|We destroy|the former (people)?
Then|We follow them up|(with) the later ones.
Thus|We deal|with the criminals.
Woe|that Day|to the deniers.
Did not|We create you|from|a water|despicable?
Then We placed it|in|an abode|safe
For|a period|known.
So We measured,|and Best|(are We to) measure 
Woe|that Day|to the deniers.
Have not|We made|the earth|a receptacle
(For the) living|and (the) dead,
And We made|therein|firmly set mountains|lofty,|and We gave you to drink|water -|sweet?
Woe|that Day|to the deniers.
"Proceed|to|what|you used to|in it|deny,
Proceed|to|a shadow|having three||columns
No|cool shade|and not|availing|against|the flame.
Indeed, it|throws up|sparks|as the fortress,
As if they (were)|camels|yellow.
Woe|that Day|to the deniers.
This|(is) a Day|not|they will speak,
And not|will it be permitted|for them|to make excuses.
Woe|that Day|to the deniers.
This|(is the) Day|(of) Judgment;|We have gathered you|and the former (people).
So if|is|for you|a plan,|then plan against Me.
Woe|that Day|to the deniers.
Indeed,|the righteous|(will be) in|shades|and springs,
And fruits|from what|they desire.
"Eat|and drink|(in) satisfaction|for what|you used to|do."
Indeed, We|thus|reward|the good-doers.
Woe|that Day|to the deniers.
"Eat|and enjoy yourselves|a little;|indeed, you|(are) criminals."
Woe|that Day|to the deniers.
And when|it is said|to them,|"Bow,"|not|they bow.
Woe|that Day|to the deniers.
Then in what|statement|after it|will they believe?
About what|are they asking one another?
About|the News|the Great,
(About) which|they|(are) concerning it|(in) disagreement.
Nay |(Soon) they will know.
Then|Nay |(soon) they will know.
Have not|We made|the earth|a resting place?
And the mountains|(as) pegs,
And We created you|(in) pairs,
And We made|your sleep|(for) rest,
And We made|the night|(as) covering,
And We made|the day|(for) livelihood,
And We constructed|over you|seven|strong,
And We placed|a lamp|burning,
And We sent down|from|the rain clouds|water|pouring abundantly,
That We may bring forth|thereby|grain|and vegetation,
And gardens|(of) thick foliage.
Indeed,|(the) Day|(of) the Judgment|is|an appointed time,
(The) Day|is blown|in|the trumpet|and you will come forth|(in) crowds,
And is opened|the heaven|and becomes|gateways,
And are moved|the mountains|and become|a mirage.
Indeed,|Hell|is|lying in wait,
For the transgressors|a place of return,
(They will) be remaining|therein|(for) ages.
Not|they will taste|therein|coolness|and not|any drink,
Except|scalding water|and purulence,
A recompense|appropriate.
Indeed, they|were|not|expecting|an account,
And they denied|Our Signs|(with) denial.
And every|thing|We have enumerated it|(in) a Book.
So taste,|and never|We will increase you|except|(in) punishment.
Indeed,|for the righteous|(is) success,
Gardens|and grapevines,
And splendid companions|well-matched,
And a cup|full.
Not|they will hear|therein|any vain talk|and not|any falsehood,
(As) a reward|from|your Lord,|a gift|(according to) account,
Lord|(of) the heavens|and the earth|and whatever|(is) between both of them|the Most Gracious,|not|they have power|from Him|(to) address.
(The) Day|will stand|the Spirit|and the Angels|(in) rows,|not|they will speak|except|(one) who -|permits|[for] him|the Most Gracious,|and he (will) say|(what is) correct.
That|(is) the Day|the True.|So whoever|wills|let him take|towards|his Lord|a return.
Indeed We|[We] have warned you|(of) a punishment|near|(the) Day|will see|the man|what|have sent forth|his hands|and will say|the disbeliever,|"O, I wish|I were|dust "
By those who extract|violently,
And those who draw out|gently,
And those who glide|swimming,
And those who race each other|(in) a race,
And those who arrange|(the) matter.
(The) Day|will quake|the quaking one,
Follows it|the subsequent,
Hearts,|that Day,|will palpitate,
Their eyes|humbled.
They say,|"Will we|indeed be returned|to|the former state?
What  When|we are|bones|decayed?"
They say,|"This|then|(would be) a return|losing."
Then only|it|(will be) a shout|single,
And behold |They|(will be) awakened.
Has|(there) come to you|(the) story|(of) Musa?
When|called him|his Lord|in the valley|the sacred|(of) Tuwa,
"Go|to|Firaun.|Indeed, he|(has) transgressed.
And say,|'Would|[for] you|[to]|[that]|purify yourself?
And I will guide you|to|your Lord|so you would fear.'"
Then he showed him|the sign|the great.
But he denied|and disobeyed.
Then|he turned his back,|striving,
And he gathered|and called out,
Then he said,|"I am|your Lord,|the Most High."
So Allah seized him||(with) an exemplary punishment|(for) the last|and the first.
Indeed,|in|that|surely (is) a lesson|for whoever|fears.
Are you|a more difficult|creation|or|the heaven.|He constructed it?
He raised|its ceiling|and proportioned it.
And He darkened|its night|and brought out|its brightness.
And the earth|after|that|He spread it.
He brought forth|from it,|its water|and its pasture,
And the mountains,|He made them firm,
(As) a provision|for you|and for your cattle.
But when|comes|the Overwhelming Calamity|the great,
(The) Day|will remember|man|what|he strove (for),
And will be made manifest|the Hellfire|to (him) who|sees,
Then as for|(him) who|transgressed,
And preferred|the life|(of) the world,
Then indeed,|the Hellfire,|it|(is) the refuge.
But as for|(him) who|feared|standing|(before) his Lord,|and restrained|his soul|from|the vain desires,
Then indeed,|Paradise -|it (is)|the refuge.
They ask you|about|the Hour,|when|(is) its arrival?
In what|(are) you|[of]|(to) mention it?
To|your Lord|(is) its finality.
Only|you|(are) a warner|(for him) who|fears it.
As though they,|(the) Day|they see it,|not|they had remained|except|an evening|or|a morning thereof.
He frowned|and turned away,
That|came to him|the blind man.
But what|would make you know|that he might|purify himself,
Or|be reminded|so would benefit him|the reminder?
As for|(him) who|considers himself free from need,
So you|to him|give attention.
And not|upon you|that not|he purifies himself.
But as for|(he) who|came to you|striving,
While he|fears,
But you|from him|(are) distracted.
Nay |Indeed, it|(is) a reminder,
So whosoever|wills|may remember it.
In|sheets|honored,
Exalted,|purified,
In (the) hands|(of) scribes.
Noble,|dutiful.
Is destroyed|[the] man,|how|ungrateful is he 
From|what|thing|He created him?
From|a semen-drop|He created him,|then He proportioned him,
Then|the way,|He made easy for him,
Then|He causes him to die|and provides a grave for him,
Then|when|He wills,|He will resurrect him.
Nay |Not|he has accomplished|what|He commanded him.
Then let look|the man|at|his food,
That We|[We] poured|the water|(in) abundance,
Then|We cleaved|the earth|splitting,
Then We caused to grow|therein|grain,
And grapes|and green fodder,
And olive|and date-palms,
And gardens|(of) thick foliage,
And fruits|and grass,
(As) a provision|for you|and for your cattle.
But when|comes|the Deafening Blast,
(The) Day|will flee|a man|from|his brother,
And his mother|and his father,
And his wife|and his children,
For every|man|among them|that Day|(will be) a matter|occupying him.
Faces,|that Day|(will be) bright,
Laughing,|rejoicing at good news.
And faces,|that Day,|upon them|(will be) dust,
Will cover them|darkness.
Those|[they]|(are) the disbelievers,|the wicked ones.
When|the sun|is wrapped up,
And when|the stars|fall, losing their luster
And when|the mountains|are moved away,
And when|the full-term she-camels|(are) left untended;
And when|the wild beasts|are gathered,
And when|the seas|are made to overflow,
And when|the souls|are paired,
And when|the female infant buried alive|is asked
For what|sin|she was killed.
And when|the pages|are laid open,
And when|the sky|is stripped away,
And when|the Hellfire|is set ablaze,
And when|Paradise|is brought near,
Will know|a soul|what|it has brought.
But nay |I swear|by the retreating planets,
Those that run|(and) disappear,
And the night|when|it departs,
And the dawn|when|it breathes
Indeed, it|(is) surely a word|(of) a Messenger|noble,
Possessor of power,||with|(the) Owner of the Throne||secure,
One to be obeyed|and|trustworthy,
And not|(is) your companion|mad.
And certainly|he saw him|in the horizon|the clear.
And not|he (is)|on|the unseen|a withholder.
And not|it|(is the) word|(of) Shaitaan|accursed.
So where|are you going?
Not|it|(is) except|a reminder|to the worlds,
For whoever|wills|among you|to|take a straight way.
And not|you will|except|that|Allah wills,||Lord|(of) the worlds.
When|the sky|(is) cleft asunder,
And when|the stars|scatter,
And when|the seas|are made to gush forth,
And when|the graves|are overturned,
Will know|a soul|what|it has sent forth|and left behind.
O|man |What|has deceived you|concerning your Lord|the Most Noble,
Who|created you,|then fashioned you|then balanced you?
In|whatever|form|what|He willed,|He assembled you.
Nay |But|you deny|the Judgment.
And indeed,|over you|(are) surely guardians,
Noble|recording,
They know|whatever|you do.
Indeed,|the righteous|(will be) surely in|bliss,
And indeed,|the wicked|(will be) surely in|Hellfire.
They will burn (in) it|(on the) Day|(of) the Judgment,
And not|they|from it|(will be) absent.
And what|can make you know|what|(is the) Day|(of) the Judgment?
Then,|what|can make you know|what|(is the) Day|(of) the Judgment?
(The) Day|not|will have power|a soul|for a soul|anything,|and the Command|that Day|(will be) with Allah.
Woe|to those who give less,
Those who|when|they take a measure|from|the people,|they take in full,
But when|they give by measure (to) them|or|they weigh (for) them|they give less.
Do not|think|those|that they|(will be) resurrected,
For a Day|Great,
(The) Day|will stand|mankind|before (the) Lord|(of) the worlds?
Nay |Indeed,|(the) record|(of) the wicked|(is) surely in|Sijjin.
And what|can make you know|what|(is) Sijjin?
A book|written.
Woe|that Day|to the deniers,
Those who|deny|(the) Day|(of) the Judgment.
And not|can deny|[of] it|except|every|transgressor|sinful.
When|are recited|to him|Our Verses,|he says,|"Stories|(of) the former (people)."
Nay |But,|(the) stain has covered|[over]|their hearts|(for) what|they used to|earn.
Nay |Indeed, they|from|their Lord|that Day|surely will be partitioned.
Then|indeed, they|(surely) will burn|(in) the Hellfire.
Then|it will be said,|"This|(is) what|you used to|[of it]|deny."
Nay |Indeed,|(the) record|(of) the righteous|(will be) surely in|Illiyin.
And what|can make you know|what|(is) Illiyun?
A book|written,
Witness it|those brought near.
Indeed,|the righteous|(will be) surely in|bliss,
On|thrones|observing.
You will recognize|in|their faces|(the) radiance|(of) bliss.
They will be given to drink|of|a pure wine|sealed,
Its seal|(will be of) musk.|And for|that|let aspire|the aspirers.
And its mixture|(is) of|Tasneem,
A spring,|will drink|from it,|those brought near.
Indeed,|those who|committed crimes|used to|at|those who|believed|laugh.
And when|they passed|by them,|they winked at one another.
And when|they returned|to|their people,|they would return|jesting.
And when|they saw them,|they said,|"Indeed,|these|surely have gone astray."
But not|they had been sent|over them|(as) guardians.
So today|those who|believed -|at|the disbelievers|they will laugh,
On|the thrones|observing.
Have (not)|been rewarded|the disbelievers|(for) what|they used (to)|do?
When|the sky|is split asunder,
And has listened|to its Lord|and was obligated,
And when|the earth|is spread,
And has cast out|what|(is) in it|and becomes empty,
And has listened|to its Lord|and was obligated.
O mankind ||Indeed, you|(are) laboring|to|your Lord|(with) exertion|and you (will) meet Him.
Then as for|(him) who|is given|his record|in his right hand,
Then soon|his account will be taken|an account,|easy,
And he will return|to|his people|happily.
But as for|(him) who|is given|his record|behind|his back,
Then soon|he will call|(for) destruction,
And he will burn|(in) a Blaze.
Indeed, he|had been|among|his people|happy,
Indeed, he|(had) thought|that|never|he would return.
Yes |Indeed,|his Lord|was|of him|All-Seer.
But nay |I swear|by the twilight glow,
And the night|and what|it envelops,
And the moon|when|it becomes full,
You will surely embark|(to) stage|from|stage.
So what|(is) for them|not|they believe,
And when|is recited|to them|the Quran,|not|they prostrate?
Nay |Those who|disbelieved|deny,
And Allah|(is) most knowing|of what|they keep within themselves.
So give them tidings|of a punishment|painful,
Except|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds.|For them|(is) a reward|never|ending.
By the sky,|containing|the constellations,
And the Day|Promised,
And (the) witness|and what is witnessed,
Destroyed were|(the) companions|(of) the pit,
(Of) the fire|full|(of) the fuel,
When|they|by it|(were) sitting,
And they|over|what|they were doing|to the believers|witnesses.
And not|they resented|[of] them|except|that|they believed|in Allah|the All-Mighty,|the Praiseworthy,
The One Who,|for Him|(is) the dominion|(of) the heavens|and the earth;|and Allah|on|every|thing|(is) a Witness.
Indeed,|those who|persecuted|the believing men|and the believing women,|then|not|they repented,|then for them|(is the) punishment|(of) Hell|and for them|(is the) punishment|(of) the Burning Fire.
Indeed,|those who|believe|and do|the righteous deeds,|for them|(will be) Gardens|flow|from|underneath it|the rivers.|That|(is) the success|the great.
Indeed,|(the) Grip|(of) your Lord|(is) surely strong.
Indeed He,|He|originates|and repeats,
And He|(is) the Oft-Forgiving,|the Most Loving,
Owner (of) the Throne||the Glorious,
Doer|of what|He intends.
Has|come to you|(the) story|(of) the hosts,
Firaun|and Thamud?
Nay |Those who|disbelieve|(are) in|denial.
But Allah|from|behind them,|encompasses.
Nay |It|(is) a Quran|Glorious,
In|a Tablet,|Guarded.
By the sky|and the night comer,
And what|can make you know|what|the night comer (is)?
(It is) the star,|the piercing 
Not|(is) every|soul|but|over it|(is) a protector.
So let see|man|from what|he is created.
He is created|from|a water,|ejected,
Coming forth|from|between|the backbone|and the ribs.
Indeed, He|to|return him|(is) Able.
(The) Day|will be tested|the secrets,
Then not|(is) for him|any|power|and not|any helper.
By the sky|which returns,|
And the earth|which cracks open,|
Indeed, it|(is) surely a Word|decisive,
And not|it|(is) for amusement.
Indeed, they|are plotting|a plot,
But I am planning|a plan.
So give respite|(to) the disbelievers.|Give respite to them -|little.
Glorify|(the) name|(of) your Lord,|the Most High,
The One Who|created,|then proportioned,
And the One Who|measured|then guided,
And the One Who|brings forth|the pasture,
And then makes it|stubble,|dark.
We will make you recite|so not|you will forget,
Except|what|Allah wills||Indeed, He|knows|the manifest|and what|is hidden.
And We will ease you|to the ease.
So remind,|if|benefits|the reminder.
He will pay heed -|(one) who|fears (Allah).
And will avoid it|the wretched one.
The one who|will burn|(in) the Fire|[the] great.
Then|not|he will die|therein|and not|will live.
Certainly,|has succeeded|(one) who|purifies (himself),
And remembers|(the) name|(of) his Lord|and prays.
Nay |You prefer|the life|(of) the world,
While the Hereafter|(is) better|and everlasting.
Indeed,|this|surely (is) in|the Scriptures|[the] former,
(The) Scriptures|(of) Ibrahim|and Musa.
Has|(there) come to you|(the) news|(of) the Overwhelming?
Faces|that Day|(will be) humbled,
Laboring,|exhausted.
They will burn|(in) a Fire|intensely hot.
They will be given to drink|from|a spring,|boiling.
Not is|for them|food|except|from|a bitter thorny plant,
Not|it nourishes|and not|it avails|from|hunger.
Faces|that Day|(will be) joyful.
With their effort|satisfied,
In|a garden|elevated.
Not|they will hear|therein|vain talk.
Therein|(will be) a spring|flowing,
Therein|(will be) thrones|raised high,
And cups|put in place,
And cushions|lined up,
And carpets|spread out.
Then do not|they look|towards|the camels,|how|they are created?
And towards|the sky,|how|it is raised?
And towards|the mountains,|how|they are fixed?
And towards|the earth,|how|it is spread out?
So remind,|only|you|(are) a reminder.
You are not|over them|a controller,
But|whoever|turns away|and disbelieves,
Then Allah will punish him||(with) the punishment|greatest.
Indeed,|to Us|(will be) their return,
Then|indeed,|upon Us|(is) their account.
By the dawn,
And the nights|ten.
And the even|and the odd,
And the night|when|it passes.
Is|in|that|(not) an oath|for those who understand?|
Did not|you see|how|dealt|your Lord|with Aad,
Iram,|possessors (of) lofty pillars,|
Which|not|had been created|like them|in|the cities,
And Thamud,|who|carved out|the rocks|in the valley,
And Firaun,|owner of stakes?|
Who|transgressed|in|the lands,
And (made) much|therein|corruption.
So poured|on them|your Lord|scourge|(of) punishment.
Indeed,|your Lord|(is) surely Ever Watchful.
And as for|man,|when||tries him|his Lord|and is generous to him|and favors him,|he says,|"My Lord|has honored me."
But|when||He tries him|and restricts|for him|his provision,|then he says|"My Lord|(has) humiliated me."
Nay |But|not|you honor|the orphan,
And not|you feel the urge|to|feed|the poor.
And you consume|the inheritance|devouring altogether,|
And you love|wealth|(with) love|immense.
Nay |When|is leveled|the earth,|pounded and crushed,|
And comes|your Lord|and the Angels,|rank upon rank,|
And is brought,|that Day,|Hell.|That Day|will remember|man,|but how|(will be) for him|the remembrance?
He will say,|"O  I wish|I had sent forth|for my life."
So that Day|not|will punish,|(as) His punishment|anyone.
And not|will bind|(as) His binding|anyone.
"O soul ||who is satisfied,
Return|to|your Lord|well pleased,|and pleasing.
So enter|among|My slaves,
And enter|My Paradise."
Nay |I swear|by this|city,
And you|(are) free (to dwell)|in this|city.
And the begetter|and what|he begot.
Certainly,|We have created|man|(to be) in|hardship.
Does he think|that|not|has power|over him|anyone?
He will say,|"I have squandered|wealth|abundant."
Does he think|that|not|sees him|anyone?
Have not|We made|for him|two eyes?
And a tongue,|and two lips?
And shown him|the two ways?
But not|he has attempted|the steep path.
And what|can make you know|what|the steep path (is)?
(It is) freeing|a neck,
Or|feeding|in|a day|of severe hunger.|
An orphan|of near relationship,|
Or|a needy person|in misery,|
Then|he is|of|those who|believe|and enjoin (each other)|to patience,|and enjoin (each other)|to compassion.
Those|(are the) companions|(of) the right (hand).
But those who|disbelieve|in Our Verses,|they|(are the) companions|(of) the left (hand).
Over them,|(will be the) Fire|closed in.
By the sun|and its brightness,
And the moon|when|it follows it,
And the day|when|it displays it,
And the night|when|it covers it,
And the heaven|and (He) Who|constructed it,
And the earth|and (He) Who|spread it,
And (the) soul|and (He) Who|proportioned it,
And He inspired it|(to distinguish) its wickedness|and its righteousness,
Indeed,|he succeeds|who|purifies it,
And indeed,|he fails|who|buries it.
Denied|Thamud|by their transgression,
When|(was) sent forth|(the) most wicked of them.
But said|to them|(the) Messenger|(of) Allah,|"(It is the) she-camel|(of) Allah|and her drink."
But they denied him,|and they hamstrung her.|So destroyed|them|their Lord|for their sin|and leveled them.
And not|He fears|its consequences.
By the night|when|it covers,
And the day|when|it shines in brightness,
And (He) Who created||the male|and the female,
Indeed,|your efforts|(are) surely diverse.
Then as for|(him) who|gives|and fears,
And believes|in the best,
Then We will ease him|towards [the] ease.
But as for|(him) who|withholds|and considers himself free from need,
And denies|the best,
Then We will ease him|towards [the] difficulty.
And not|will avail|him|his wealth|when|he falls.
Indeed,|upon Us|(is) the guidance.
And indeed,|for Us|(is) the Hereafter|and the first (life).
So I warn you|(of) a Fire|blazing,
Not|will burn (in) it|except|the most wretched,
The one who|denied|and turned away.
But will be removed from it|the righteous,
The one who|gives|his wealth|(to) purify himself,
And not|for anyone|with him|any|favor|to be recompensed
Except|seeking|(the) Countenance|(of) his Lord,|the Most High.
And soon, surely|he will be pleased.
By the morning brightness,
And the night|when|it covers with darkness,
Not|has forsaken you|your Lord|and not|He is displeased,
And surely the Hereafter|(is) better|for you|than|the first.
And soon|will give you|your Lord|then you will be satisfied.
Did not|He find you|an orphan|and give shelter?
And He found you|lost,|so He guided,
And He found you|in need,|so He made self-sufficient.
So as for|the orphan,|then (do) not|oppress,
And as for|one who asks,|then (do) not|repel,
But as for|(the) Favor|(of) your Lord|narrate.
Have not|We expanded|for you|your breast?
And We removed|from you|your burden
Which|weighed upon|your back,
And We raised high|for you|your reputation.
So indeed,|with|the hardship|(is) ease.
Indeed,|with|the hardship|(is) ease.
So when|you finish,|then labor hard.
And to|your Lord|turn your attention.
By the fig,|and the olive,
And (the) Mount|Sinai,
And this|[the] city,|[the] secure,
Indeed,|We created|man|in|(the) best|mould.
Then|We returned him|(to the) lowest|(of the) low,
Except|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds,|then for them|(is a) reward|never ending.|
Then what|causes you to deny|after (this)|the judgment?
Is not|Allah|(the) Most Just|(of) the Judges?
Read|in (the) name|(of) your Lord|the One Who|created -
He created|man|from|a clinging substance.
Read,|and your Lord|(is) the Most Generous,
The One Who|taught|by the pen,
Taught|man|what|not|he knew.
Nay |Indeed,|man|surely transgresses,
That|he sees himself|self-sufficient.
Indeed,|to|your Lord|(is) the return.
Have you seen|the one who|forbids
A slave|when|he prays?
Have you seen|if|he is|upon|[the] guidance,
Or|he enjoins|[of the] righteousness?
Have you seen|if|he denies|and turns away?
Does not|he know|that|Allah|sees?
Nay |If|not|he desists,|surely We will drag him|by the forelock,
A forelock|lying,|sinful.
Then let him call|his associates,
We will call|the Angels of Hell.
Nay |(Do) not|obey him.|But prostrate|and draw near (to Allah).
Indeed, We|revealed it|in|(the) Night|(of) Power.
And what|can make you know|what|(the) Night|(of) Power (is)?
(The) Night|(of) Power|(is) better|than|a thousand|month(s).
Descend|the Angels|and the Spirit|therein,|by (the) permission|(of) their Lord,|for|every|affair,
Peace|it (is)|until|(the) emergence|(of) the dawn.
Not|were|those who|disbelieved|from|(the) People of the Book||and the polytheists,|to be abandoned|until|(there) comes to them|the clear evidence,
A Messenger|from|Allah,|reciting|pages|purified,
Wherein|(are) writings|correct.
And not|became divided|those who|were given|the Book,|until|after what|||came (to) them|(of) the clear evidence.
And not|they were commanded|except|to worship|Allah|(being) sincere|to Him|(in) the religion,|upright,|and to establish|the prayer,|and to give|the zakah.|And that|(is the) religion|the correct.
Indeed,|those who|disbelieve|from|(the) People|(of) the Book|and the polytheists|(will be) in|(the) Fire|(of) Hell|abiding eternally|therein.|Those -|they|(are the) worst|(of) the creatures.
Indeed,|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds,|those -|they|(are the) best|(of) the creatures.
Their reward|(is) with|their Lord -|Gardens|(of) Eternity,|flow|from|underneath them|the rivers,|will abide|therein|forever.|Allah (will be) pleased||with them|and they (will be) pleased|with Him.|That|(is) for whoever|feared|his Lord.
When|is shaken|the earth|(with) its earthquake,
And brings forth|the earth|its burdens,
And says|man,|"What|(is) with it?"
That Day,|it will report|its news,
Because|your Lord|inspired|[to] it.
That Day|will proceed|the mankind|(in) scattered groups|to be shown|their deeds.
So whoever|does|(equal to the) weight|(of) an atom|good,|will see it,
And whoever|does|(equal to the) weight|(of) an atom|evil,|will see it.
By the racers|panting,
And the producers of sparks,|striking
And the chargers|(at) dawn,
Then raise|thereby|dust,
Then penetrate thereby (in the) center||collectively,
Indeed,|mankind,|to his Lord,|(is) surely ungrateful.
And indeed, he|on|that|surely (is) a witness,
And indeed he (is),|in (the) love|(of) wealth|(is) surely intense.
But does not|he know|when|will be scattered|what|(is) in|the graves,
And is made apparent|what|(is) in|the breasts?
Indeed,|their Lord|about them,|that Day,|(is) surely All-Aware.
The Striking Calamity 
What|(is) the Striking Calamity?
And what|will make you know|what|(is) the Striking Calamity?
(The) Day|will be|the mankind|like moths,|scattered,
And will be|the mountains|like wool,|fluffed up.
Then as for|(him) whose|(are) heavy|his scales,
Then he|(will be) in|a life,|pleasant.
But as for|(him) whose|(are) light|his scales,
His abode|(will be the) Pit.
And what|will make you know|what|it is?
A Fire,|intensely hot.
Diverts you|the competition to increase
Until|you visit|the graves.
Nay |Soon|you will know.
Then,|nay |Soon|you will know.
Nay |If|you know|(with) a knowledge|(of) certainty.
Surely you will see|the Hellfire.
Then|surely you will see it|(with the) eye|(of) certainty.
Then,|surely you will be asked|that Day|about|the pleasures.
By the time,
Indeed,|mankind|(is) surely, in|loss,
Except|those who|believe|and do|righteous deeds|and enjoin (each other)|to the truth|and enjoin (each other)|to [the] patience.
Woe|to every|slanderer|backbiter 
The one who|collects|wealth|and counts it.
Thinking|that|his wealth|will make him immortal
Nay |Surely he will be thrown|in|the Crusher.
And what|will make you know|what|the Crusher (is)?
A Fire|kindled by Allah,|
Which|mounts up|to|the hearts.
Indeed, it|(will be) upon them|closed over,
In|columns|extended.
Have not|you seen|how|dealt|your Lord|with (the) Companions|(of the) Elephant?
Did not|He make|their plan|go astray?|
And He sent|against them|birds|(in) flocks.
Striking them|with stones|of|baked clay.
Then He made them|like straw|eaten up.
For (the) familiarity|(of the) Quraish,
Their familiarity|(with the) journey|(of) winter|and summer,
So let them worship|(the) Lord|(of) this|House,
The One Who|feeds them|[from]|(against) hunger|and gives them security|from|fear.
Have you seen|the one who|denies|the Judgment?
Then that|(is) the one who|repulses|the orphan,
And (does) not|feel the urge|to|feed|the poor.
So woe|to those who pray,
Those who|[they]|about|their prayers|(are) neglectful,
Those who|[they]|make show.
And they deny|[the] small kindness.
Indeed, We,|We have given you|Al-Kauthar,
So pray|to your Lord|and sacrifice.
Indeed,|your enemy -|he (is)|the one cut off.
Say,|"O disbelievers |
Not|I worship|what|you worship.
And not|you|(are) worshippers|(of) what|I worship
And not|I am|a worshipper|(of) what|you worship.
And not|you|(are) worshippers|(of) what|I worship.
For you|(is) your religion,|and for me|(is) my religion."
When|comes|(the) Help|(of) Allah|and the Victory,
And you see|the people|entering|into|(the) religion|(of) Allah|(in) multitudes.
Then glorify|with (the) praises|(of) your Lord|and ask His forgiveness.|Indeed, He|is|Oft-Returning.
Perish|(the) hands|(of) Abu Lahab||and perish he.
Not|(will) avail|him|his wealth|and what|he earned.
He will be burnt|(in) a Fire|of Blazing Flames,|
And his wife,|(the) carrier|(of) firewood,
In|her neck|(will be) a rope|of|palm-fiber.
Say,|"He|(is) Allah,|the One.
Allah,|the Eternal, the Absolute.
Not|He begets|and not|He is begotten.
And not|is|for Him|any [one] equivalent."|
Say,|"I seek refuge|in (the) Lord|(of) the dawn,
From|(the) evil|(of) what|He created,
And from|(the) evil|(of) darkness|when|it spreads,
And from|( the) evil|(of) the blowers|in|the knots,
And from|(the) evil|(of) an envier|when|he envies."
Say,|"I seek refuge|in (the) Lord|(of) mankind,
(The) King|(of) mankind,
(The) God|(of) mankind,
From|(the) evil|(of) the whisperer,|the one who withdraws,
The one who|whispers|in|(the) breasts|(of) mankind,
From|the jinn|and men.
