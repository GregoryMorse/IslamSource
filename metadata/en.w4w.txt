GreatMasterpiece40=The jussive|of present tense|It says:|and the jussive|eight|ten,|and they are:|did not,|and did not/what,|and did not,|and what not,|and the lam|of command|and supplication,|and|(do

then/therefore|in|poetry|specifically.|And I say:|the tools|which|make jussive mood|the verb|present tense|eight|ten|of jussive,|and these|tools|divide|to|two parts:|the part|first,|each|one|in it|makes jussive mood|a verb|one,|and the part|second|each|one|from it|makes jussive mood|two verbs.|For|the part|first,|then six|particles,|and they are:|did not,|and did not/when,|and did not,|and what not,|and the lam|of command|and supplication,|and|(do not)|in|prohibition|and supplication,|and each of them|particles|with consensus|of the grammarians.|For|(did not)|then particle|of negation|and jussive|and change,|just like|its saying|the Most High:|(not|were|those who|disbelieved)(98:1)|and its saying|the Most High:|(say|did not|you believe)(49:14).|And for|(did not/when)|then

certainly|mentioned|the author|that it|follows|for the prohibition|and the supplication,|and each|from the two|is meant|with it|the request|of refraining/abstaining|from|the action/verb|and leaving it,|and the difference|between the two|that|prohibition|is|from|the highest|to the lowest,|just like:|(do not|fear)(51:28)|and just like:|(do not|say|pay heed to us/listen to us)(2:104)|and just

GreatMasterpiece58=The particles|of the conjunction|It says:|(chapter|of the conjunction)|and the particles|of the conjunction|are ten,|and they are:|the waw/and,|and the faa/and/so/then,|and then/next,|and or,|and or,|and either,|and but,|and not,|and but,|and until|in|some|places.|And I say:|for the conjunctive|two meanings:|the first|linguistic|and the other|terminological.|For|its meaning|linguistic|then it is:|inclination/liking/attachment,|you say:|taking pity|any person|upon|any person|taking pity|with liking,|refering|that it|has an inclination/liking|to it|and to be compassionate/sympathetic|upon him.|And for|the conjuctive|in|the terminlogy|then it is|two parts:|the first:|the conjunction/apposition|explicative,|and the second:|the conjunction|coordinating.|Then for|the conjunction/apposition|explicative|then it is|(the follower|inert/static|shown|for its follower|in|definiteness|specifically|for it|in|indefiniteness)|then example|of conjuction/apposition|explicative|in|the definite|(came to me|Muhammad|your father)|then your father:|conjunction/apposition|explicative|upon|Muhammad,|and each of the two|definite,|and the second|in|the example|makes clear/showing|for the first,|and example|in|indefinite|its saying|the Most High|(from|water|festering)(14:16)|then festering|conjunction/apposition|explicative|upon|the water,|and each of the two|indefinite,|and the second|in|the example|specifying|for the first.|And for|the conjunction|coordinating|then it is|(the follower|which|is in the middle|between it|and between|the one being followed/word it follows|one|of the particles|of conjunction)|and these|particles|they are:|1-|The waw/and,|and it is|for entirely|joining;|so it joins|by it|two successive/following,|just like:|(came|Muhammad|and Ali)|if|was|joining|together,|and joining|with it|the preceding|upon|the delayed,|just like:|(came|Ali|and Mahmood)|if|was|joining|Mahmood|preceding|upon|joining|Ali,|and joining|with it|the delayed|upon|the preceding,|just like:|(came|Ali|and Muhammad)|if|was|joining|Muhammad|delayed|from|joining|Ali.|2-|The fah/so/then,|and it is|for succession/arrangement|and following/pursuing,|and the meaning|of succession/arrangement:|that|the second|after|the first,|and the meaning|of following/pursuing:|that it|pursues/follows it|with not|delay,|just like:|(arrived|the horsemen|then the soldiers)|if|was|joining|the horsemen|preceding|and not|did|between|the arrival|of the two parties|a delay.|3-|Then,|and it is|for succession/arrangement|with|slacking/arrangement,|and meaning|of succession/arrangement|certainly|preceded,|and the meaning|of slacking/arrangement:|that|between|the first|and the second|is a delay,|just like:|(sent|Allah|Moses|then|Jesus|then|Muhammad|upon them|salutations|and peace).|4-|The or,|and it is|for selecting|or|permissibility,|and the difference|between the two|that|selecting|not|does allow/is permissible|with it|all,|and permissibility|does allow|with it|all;|then example|of selecting|(marry|Hind|or|her sister)|and example|of permissibility|(study|fiqh/Islamic jurisprudence|or|Arabic grammar)|then certainly|you have|from|Islamic law|proof|upon|that it|not|is allowed|together|between|Hind|and her sister|with marriage,|and not|doubt|in|that it|is allowed|together|between|fiqh/Islamic jurisprudence|and Arabic grammar|in studies.|5-|The or,|and it is|for the request|of specification|after|the hamza|of questioning|just like:|(did you study|fiqh/Islamic jurisprudence|or|Arabic grammar?).|6-|And either,|with condition|that|it precedes|with the like of it,|and it is|similar|(or)|in|the two meanings|just like|its saying|the Most High:|(then bind firmly|the bond|either|a favor/oblige them by setting them free|thereafter|or|take ransom)(47:4),|and just like:|(marry|either|Hind|or|her sister).|7-|And but,|and it is|for signaling/striking/outstanding,|and meaning|it makes|what|is before it|in|ruling|of what was silence/not answered|about it,|just like:|(not|came|Muhammad|but|Bakr)|and required|for the conjunction|with it|two conditions;|the first:|that|is|conjuncted/the word which is followed by it|with it|a singular|not|a sentence,|and second:|that not|prededes|a questioning particle.|8-|Not,|and it is|negating|that which|is after it|the same/self|of the ruling|which|establishes/confirms|for that which|before it|just like:|(came|Bakr|not|Khalid).|9-|But,|and it is|refering|upon|approval|of information|that|is before it|and establishing/confirming|its opposite|for that which|is after it|just like:|(not|I love|those who are lazy|but|hard workers/those who are diligent)|and required|that|precedes it|negation|or|prohibition,|and that|is|for the word following/conjuncted|with it|singular,|and that not|precedes it|the waw/and.|10-|Until,|and it is|for gradual/progressiveness|and for goal/end/objective,|and the gradual/progressiveness:|and it is|refers|upon|passing/elapsing|of information|one thing|then/after another thing,|just like:|(die|people|even|the prophets).|And comes|(until)|starting|other than|conjunctive,|if|was|what|is after it|a sentence,|just like:|(came|our friends|even|Khalid|attending)|and comes|genitive|just like|its saying|the Most High:|(until|breaks/rising of|the dawn)(97:5)|and for this|said|the author|(and until|in|some|places).

GreatMasterpiece67=The condition|It says:|(the chapter|of the condition)|the condition|is:|the noun,|accusative case,|explaining|for that which|is obscure/ambiguous/dubious|from|conditions/situations,|just like|your saying:|(came|Zayd|riding)|and|(I rode|the horse|saddling)|and|(I met|the servant|of Allah|riding)|and what|is similar to|that.|And I say:|the condition|in|language|(what|upon it|mankind|from|good|or|bad/evil)|and it is|in|terminology|of the grammarians|a phrase|from|(the noun,|additional/extra,|accusative case,|explaining|for that which|is obscure/ambiguous/dubious|from|conditions/situations).|And our saying:|(the noun)|includes|the clear|for example|(laughing).|In|your saying:|(came|Muhammad|laughing)|and includes|the interpreted|with the clear|for example|(he laughs)|in|your saying:|(came|Muhammad|he laughs)|then certainly it|is in|interpreting|your saying:|(laughing)|and like that|our saying:|(came|Muhammad|with him|his brother)|then certainly it|is in|interpreting|your saying:|(accompanying|for his brother).|And our saying:|(extra/additional)|its meaning|that it|is not|a part|from|the speech/words;|then/hence free|from it|the predicate.|And our saying:|(accusative case)|then/hence free|from it|the nominative case|and the genitive case.|And certainly what|makes accusative|the condition|with the verb|and similar to|the verb:|like the noun|of the active element/participle,|and the infinitive,|and the adverb,|and the noun|pointing/demonstrative.|And our saying:|(explanation|for that which|is obscure/ambiguous|from|conditions)|its meaning|that|the condition|explains|what|is hidden|and concealed|from|the descriptions|those possessing|knowledge|or|other than them.|Then|indeed it|might|be|an explanation|for the description|of the active element,|just like:|(came|the servant|of Allah|riding)|or|explanation|for the description|of the object/acted upon|by it,|just like:|(I rode|the horse|saddling),|and might|be|possible|for both cases|together,|just like:|(I met|the servant|of Allah|riding).|And like what|highlights/comes|the condition|from|the active element|and the object/acted upon|by it|then might it|highlight/come|from|the predicate,|just like:|(you|are my friend|sincere),|and might|highlight/come|from|the genitive case|from the particle/preposition|of genitive,|just like:|(I passed|by Hind|riding)|and might|highlight/come|from|the genitive case|of the attachement/possession construction,|just like|its saying|the Most High:|(that|follow|the creed|of Abraham|upright|)(16:123)|then upright:|a condition|from|Abraham,|and Abraham|is genitive case|with the fatha|replacement|from|the kasra,|and it is|genitive case|with attachment/possession construction|(creed)|to it.|The conditions|of the state/condition|and the conditions|the follower/associate|It says:|and not|is|except|indefinite,|and not|is|except|after|complete|speech,|and not|is|its associate/follower|except|definite.|And I say:|found|in|the condition|that|is|indefinite,|and not|permits/allows|that|is|definite,|and if|came|the composition|in it|the condition|definite|in|appearance,|then certainly it|is found|interpreted|this|definiteness|by indefiteness|example|their saying:|(came|the leader/commander/prince|on his own/alone),|then certainly|(on his own/alone)|a condition|from|the leader/commander/prince,|then it is|the definiteness|with the attachment/possession construction|to|the pronoun|and because it|in|interpreting|is indefinite|it is|your saying:|(single/alone)|then like that you|say:|(came|the leader/commander/prince|alone),|and example|of that|their saying:|(he sent it|struggling/fighting),|which:|struggle/fight,|and|(they came|the first available|then the first)|which:|sequence/in order.|And the origin|in|the condition|that|comes|after|the fulfillment/completion|of the speech,|and the meaning|of the fulfillment/completion|of the speech:|that|takes|the verb|its active element|and the subject|its predicate.|And perhaps|it is necessary/essential|precedes|the condition|upon|all|parts|of the speech,|like what|if|was|the condition|the noun|of questioning/interogative,|just like:|(how|did arrive|Ali)|then how:|a noun|of questioning/interogative|structural|upon|the fatha|in|place|of accusative|condition|from|Ali,|and not|permits/allows|delay|of the noun|of questioning/interogative.|And includes|in|the associate/follower|of the condition|that|is|definite,|then not|permits/allows|that|is|indefinite|with other than|justification/good reason.|And from what|justifies/gives reason|comes|the condition|from|the indefinite|that|begins|the condition|upon it,|like the saying|of the poet:|for Maya|deserted ruins/remains|is a house|it appears/becomes visible|as if it is|damaged/imperfect/bright sword|then deserted ruins/remains:|a condition|from|(house)|and house|indefinite|and justifyes|finding|the condition|from it|preceding it|upon it.|And from what|justifies|finding|the

High:|(in|four|days/periods|equal)(41:10)|then equal:|a condition|from|(four)|and it is|indefinite,|and justifies|finding|the condition|in it|for is it|attached/possessing,|and example|second|the

GreatMasterpiece68=The specification|It says:|(the chapter|of the specification)|the specification|it is:|the noun,|the accusative case,|the explanation|for that which|is obscure|from|the

more honorable/noble|than you|as a father)|and|(he is more beautiful|than you|in facial appearance/looks).|And I say:|for the specification|in|the language|are two meanings;|the first:|explanation|without any exception/absolute,|you say:|I explain|thus/like this,|you want|that you|explained/interpreted;|and the second:|separating|some|matters|from|some others|you say:|I separated|the people,|you want|that you|separate|some of them|from|some others.|And the specification|in|terminology|of the grammarians|a phrase|from|(the noun,|the clear noun,|accusative

saying:|(the clear noun)|for removing/taking away|the noun|interpretation,|then if|the specification|not|is|a sentence|nor|an adverb,|with difference|of the condition|like what|previously|in|its

it|the excepted|from it,|and meaning|being|positive,|that not|preceded it|negation|or|its similar,|and similar|of negation:|the prohibition,|and the questioning/interogative,|and meaning|being|negative,|that|preceding it|one|of these|things.|Then if|was|the speech|preceding|complete|positive|necessary|accusative|of the noun|occurring|after|(except)|upon|exception|just like|your saying:|(stood|the people|except|Zaid)|and your saying:|(left|the people|except|Amr)|then Zaid|and Amr:|two excepted|from|speech|complete|for mentioning|the excepted|from it|-|and it is|(the people)|in|the first|and|(the people)|in|the second|-|the speech|with|that|is positive|for lack of|came before|negation|or|its similar;|then necessary|accusative of both of them,|and this|is|the condition|first.|And if|was|the speech|preceding|complete|negative|it is allowed|in it|to follow|upon|compensation/substitution|or|the accusative|upon|the exception,|just like|your saying:|(not|stood|the people|except|Zaid)|then Zaid:|exception|from|speech|complete|for mentioned|the excepted|from it,|and it is|the people,|and the speech|with|that|negation|for came before|(not)|the negation;|then allows|in it|to follow;|then you say|(except|Zaid)|with the nominative;|because|the excepted|from it|nominative case,|and the substitute|of the nominative case|is nominative case,|and allows|in it|upon|a little|the accusative|upon|the exception;|then you say:|(except|Zaid)|and this|is|the condition|second.|And if|was|the speech|preceding|incomplete,|and not|is|except|negative,|was|the exception|upon|according to|what|before|(except)|from|the factors/causes/functions;|then if|was|the function|requiring|the nominative|upon|active element|its nominative|upon it,|just like|(not|attended|except|Ali),|then if|was|the function|requiring|the accusative|upon|the object/acted upon|of its accusative|upon it,|just like|(not|I saw|except|Ali)|and if|was|the function|requiring|the genitive|with particle|from|particles/prepositions|of genitive|its genitive|by it,|just like:|(not|I passed|except|by Zaid)|and this|is|the condition|third.|The exception|with other than|and its sisters|It says:|and the exception|with except/other than/unlike,|and except/other than/unlike,|and except/other than/unlike,|and other than|genitive case|not|other.|And I say:|the noun|occurring|after|a tool/instrument|from|these|tools/particles|four|found|its genitive|with an attachment/possession construction|of the tool/instrument|to it,|for|the tool/instrument|itself|then certainly it|takes|the ruling|of the noun|occurring|after|(except)|upon|explanation/details|which|previous:|then if|was|the speech|complete|positive|its accusative|necessary|upon|the exception,|just like:|(stood|the people|except|Zaid)|and if|was|the speech|complete|negative|its following|for that which|before it|or|its accusative,|just like:|(not|visited me|anyone|except|the best/superior/good),|or:|(except|the best/superior/good)|and if|was|the speech|incomplete|negative|it will be carried out|upon|according to|the function/causes,|just like|(not|connect|with other than|the best/superior/good).|The exception|with except/apart from|and its sisters|It says:|And the exception|with except/apart from,|and except/apart from,|and except/apart from,|it permits|its accusative|and its genitive,|just like:|(stood|the people|except|Zaid,|and Zaid)|and|(except|Amr|and Amr),|and|(except|Bakr|and Bakr).|And I say:|the noun|occurring|after|a tool/instrument|from|these|particles|three|permit|for you|that|its accusative case,|and permit|for you|that|its genitive case,|and the reason|in|that|is that|these|tools/instruments|are used as|verbs|at times,|and are used|particles|at times|other|upon|what|preceded,|then if|you indicate that they are|verbs|accusative|what|after them|upon|that it|is an object/acted upon|by it,|and the acted element|a pronoun|hidden|necessary/compulsory,|and if|you indicate that they are|particles|genitive|what|is after them|upon|that it|is genitive case|with them.|And the cause|of this|frequent changing|in what|when|did not|come before|upon them|(not)|of infinitive;|then if|came before|upon|one|from them|(not)|is essential|accusative|what|is after them,|and the cause|of that|is that|(not)|of infinitive|not|entering|except|upon|the verbs;|then they|are verbs|under no circumstance|if|preceding them,|then just like:|(stood|the people|except|Zaid)|permits|in it|accusative|(Zaid)|and its genitive,|and just like:|(stood|the people|not|other than|Zaid)|not|allowed|in it|except|accusative|(Zaid)|and Allah|glorious|and exalted be He|the Most High|and He knows.|Questions|What|is|the exceptions|linguistically|and terminologically?|What|are|tools/instruments|of exception?|Into|how many|parts|divides|the tools/instruments|of exception?|How many|conditions|for the noun|occurring|after|except?|When|is necessary|the accusative|of the noun|occurring|after|except?|When|permits|the accusative|of the noun|occurring|after|except|and its followers|for that which|is before them?|What|is the meaning|being|the speech|complete?|What|is the meaning|being|the speech|negative?|What|is the ruling|of the

of|(no)|function of|indeed/certainly|It says:|(chapter of|(no))|know|that|(no)|makes accusative case|the indefinite|with other than|noonation|if|directly preceding|the indefinite|and did not|repeat|(no)|just like|(no|man|in|the house).|And I say:|know|that|(no)|negation|for universal|functioning|the function of|(indeed/certainly)|then makes accusative case|the noun|oral/expression|or|in place of|and makes nominative case|the predicate.|And it is|not|functioning|this|function|essential|except|with four|conditions:|the first|that|is|its noun|indefinite.|The second:|that|is|its noun|connected|with it:|which|other than|separation|from it|and if|with the predicate.|And the third:|that|is|its noun|indefinite|also.|And the fourth:|that not|repeated|(no).|Then|know|that|the noun of|(no)|upon|three|kinds,|the first|singular,|and the second|attached/possessing|to|an indefinite,|and the third|similar|with the attached/possessed.|For|the singular|in|this|chapter,|and in|the chapter|of the vocative,|and is it:|(that which|is not|attached/possessed|nor|similar|with the attached/possessed)|then entering|in it|dual,|and plural|of brokenness,|and the plural|of masculinity|sound,|and the plural|of femininity|sound.|And its ruling|that it|builds/is structural|upon|what|makes accusative|by it:|then when|was|its accusative|with fatha|it is structured|upon|the fatha,|just like:|(no|man|in|the home),|and if|was|its accusative|with the yah|-|and that|the dual|and plural|of masculinity|sound|-|structural|upon|the yah|just like:|(no|two men|in|the house)|and when|was|its accusative|with the kasra|replacement|for|the fatha|-|and that|is plural|of femininity|sound|-|structural|upon|the kasra,|just like:|(there are no|righteous women|today).|And for|the attached/possessed|in|accusative|with the fatha|apparent|or|with that which|replaced/substituted|for it,|just like:|(no|student|of knowledge|is hated).|And for|the similar|-|attached/possessed|-|and it is|(that which|connected|with it|things|from|completion|of its meaning)|then example|of the attached/possessed|in|the ruling:|which|makes accusative|with the fatha,|just like:|(no|straightness/honorability/righteousness|of his condition|among|the people|is disliked).|It says:|then if|did not|come immediately after it|necessitates|the nominative|and necessitates|repeating|(no)|just like:|(not|in|the house|a man|nor|a woman)|then if|is repeated|it is permissible to have|its function|and its cancellation,|then if|you want|you say:|(no|man|in|the house|nor|woman)|and if|you want|you say:|(not|a man|in|the house|nor|a woman).|And I say:|certainly|you knew|that|the condition|essential|of the function of|(no)|functioning|(certainly/indeed)|four,|and this|discussion|in|the explanation|of the ruling|if|unfulfilled|a condition|from|the conditions|four|preceding.|And refering to|that|is that it|if|occurring|after|(no)|is definite|necessitates|cancellation of|(no)|and its repetition,|just like|(not|Muhammad|visited me|nor|Bakr)|and if|a separation|between|no|and its noun|separating|it,|essential|like that|its cancellation|and its repetition|just like|(no|in there|bad effect|and no|they|from it|will be intoxicated)(37:47)|then bad effect:|a subject|delayed,|and in there:|relating|with deletion|of the predicate|coming before,|and|(no)|negation|unpointed,|and if|repeated|(no)|not|necessary|its function,|rather|permits/allows|its function|if|fulfilled|the remaining|conditions,|and permits/allows|its cancellation;|then you say|upon|the function|(no|man|in|the home|nor|a woman)|with fatha of|man|and a woman,|and you say|upon|the cancellation|(not|a man|in|the home|nor|a woman)|with nominative of|a man|and a woman.|Questions|What|which|makes|(no)|the negation|for universality?|What|conditions|necessitate|functioning of|(no)|the negation|of
