He then came back and I poured water upon his hands from the skin vessel. He then washed his hands and face. He tried to get his forearms out (of the gown), but the sleeves of the gown were too narrow, so he entered back both his hands, and brought them out from beneath the gown. He washed his forearms up to the elbows and wiped his head and wiped over his socks. He then mounted (his camel) and we began to proceed until we found people offering the prayer.

He tried to get his forearms out, but the sleeve of the gown was very nar-row, so he brought his hands out from under the gown. I then bent down to take off his socks.

When he (the enemy) perceived that they (the Muslims) had become aware of his presence, he ran away.
01.0080.0198 : When the man from the Muhajirun saw the (man from the Ansar) bleeding, he asked him: Glory be to Allah! Why did you not wake me up  the first time when he shot at you.
01.0080.0198 : He replied: I was busy reciting a chapter of the Qur'an. I did not like to leave it.

He replied: Ablution is necessary for one who sleeps while he is lying down. Uthman and Hannad added: For when he lies down, his joints are relaxed.
01.0081.0202 : Abu Dawud said: The statement "ablution is necessary for one who sleeps while one is lying down" is a Munkar (rejected) tradition. It has been narrated only by Yazid Abu Khalid al-Dalani, on the authority of Qatadah.

He (Ibn 'Abbas) said: The Prophet (may peace be upon him) was protected (during his sleep). 'A'ishah reported: The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: My eyes sleep, but my heart does not sleep. Shu'bah said: Qatadah heard from Abu'l-'Aliyah only four traditions: the tradition about Jonah son of Matthew, the tradition reported by Ibn Umar about prayer, the tradition stating that the judges are three, and the tradition narrated by Ibn 'Abbas saying: (This tradition) has been narrated to me by reliable persons; 'Umar is one of them, and the most reliable of them in my opinion is 'Umar. Abu Dawud said: I asked Ahmad b. Hanbal about the tradition narrated by Yazid al-D�lini. He rebuked me out of respect for him.

01.0084.0208 : 'Ali b. Abi Talib said to al-Miqdad, and made a similar statement as above. Al-Miqdad asked him (the Prophet). The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He should wash his penis and testicles.
01.0084.0208 : Abu Dawud said: The tradition has been narrated by al-Thawri and a group of narrators from Hisham on the authority of his father from al-Miqdad, from 'All reporting from the Prophet (may peace be upon him).

01.0090.0287 : He said: I suggest that you should use cotton, for it absorbs the blood.  She replied: It is too copious for that.  He said: Then take a cloth.  She replied: It is too copious for that, for my blood keeps flowing.  The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: I shall give you two commands; whichever of them you follow, that will be sufficient for you without the other, but you know best whether you are strong enough to follow both of them.
01.0090.0287 : He added: This is a stroke of the Devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then wash. And when you see that you are purified and quite clean, pray during twenty-three or twenty-four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you, and do so every month, just as women menstruate and are purified at the time of their menstruation and their purification.
01.0090.0287 : But if you are strong enough to delay the noon (Zuhr) prayer and advance the afternoon ('Asr) prayer, to wash, and then combine the noon and the afternoon prayer; to delay the sunset prayer and advance the night prayer, to wash, and then combine the two prayers, do so: and to wash at dawn, do so: and fast if you are able to do so if possible;
01.0090.0287 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Of the two commands this is more to my liking.

When we came o the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), the incident was reported to him. He said: They killed him, may Allah kill them! Could they not ask when they did not know?

He said to the one who performed the ablution and repeated: For you there is double reward.
01.0090.0338 : Abu Dawud said: Besides Ibn Nafi' this is transmitted by al-Laith from 'Umairah b. Abi Najiyyah from Bakr b. Sawdah on the authority of 'Ata' b. Yasar from the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him).

It was a sort of trelis of vine.

Ibn 'Abbas then said: Then Allah, the Exalted, provided wealth (to the people) and they wore clothes other than the woolen, and were spared from work, and their mosque became vast.

(Surah) al-Anfal is the first surah that was revealed at Medina, and (Surah) al-Bara'ah was revealed last in the Qur'an, and its contents were similar to those of al-Anfal.

If he sits in a place where he can listen (to the sermon) and look (at the imam), and he does not remain silent, he will have the burden of it.

Then they should stand and complete their remaining rak'ah, and utter the salutation.
02.0434.1235 : Abu Dawud said: This tradition reported by Yahya b. Sa'id from al-Qasim is similar to the one transmitted by Yazid b.

The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) stood up to offer the afternoon prayer. One section stood with him (to pray) and the other was standing before the enemy, and their backs were towards the qiblah. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) uttered the takbir and all of them too uttered the takbir, i.e. those who were with him and those who were facing the enemy. Then the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) offered one rak'ah and the section that was with him also prayed one rak'ah. He then prostrated himself and those who were with him also prostrated, while the other section was standing before the enemy.
02.0435.1236 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then stood up and the section with him also stood up. They went and faced the enemy and the section that was previously facing the enemy stepped forward.

Then they stood up and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon) prayed another rak'ah and all of them bowed and prostrated along with him. After that the section that was standing before the enemy came forward and they bowed and prostrated, while the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) remained seated and also those who were with him.

He added to the words "when he bowed along with those who were with him and prostrated" the words "when they stood up, they retraced their footsteps to the rows of their companions". He did not mention the words "their back was towards the qiblah".
02.0435.1237 : Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been transmitted by 'A'ishah, Ummul Mu'minin through a different chain of transmitters. She said:The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) uttered the takbir and the section that was in the same row with him also uttered the takbir. He then bowed and they also bowed, and he prostrated and they also prostrated. Then he raised his head and they also raised (their heads). The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then remained seated. They prostrated alone and stood up and retraced their footsteps and stood behind them.
02.0435.1237 : Then the other section came; they stood up and uttered the takbir and bowed by themselves. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) prostrated himself and they also prostrated with him.

Then both the sections stood up and prayed with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). He bowed and they also bowed, and then he prostrated himself and they also prostrated themselves. Then he returned and performed the second prostration and they also prostrated with him as quickly as possible, showing no slackness in quick prostration.

Thereafter they stood up and completed the remaining rak'ah; they went away and the other section completed their remaining rak'ah. Abu Dawud said: This tradition has been narrated by Nafi' and Khalid b. Ma'dan from Ibn 'Umar in like manner from the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him).

I proceeded walking towards him while I was praying making a sign. When I reached near him, he said to me: Who are you? I replied: A man from the Arabs; it came to me that you were gathering (an army) for this man (i.e. the Prophet). Hence I came to you in connection with this matter.

They said: Convey our regards to her from all of us and ask her about the two rak'ahs after the afternoon prayer; and tell her that we have been informed that she prays them; and we are told that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) prohibited them. I entered upon her and told her that for which they had sent me. She said: Ask Umm Salamah. I returned to them Ibn 'Abbas and others) and informed them about her opinion.

Then pray as much as you like, because the prayer is witnessed and recorded till the shadow of a lance be- comes equal to it. Then cease prayer, for at that time the Hell-fire is heated up and doors of Hell are opened.
02.0450.1272 : When the sun declines, pray as much as you like, for the prayer is witnessed till you pray the afternoon prayer; then cease prayer till the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of the Devil, and (at that time) the infidels offer prayer for it. He narrated a lengthy tradition.

Sulaiman from 'Amr b. Malik al-Nakri from Abu al-Jauza' from Ibn 'Abbas as his own statement (and not as a statement of the Prophet). But the version of Rawh has the words: "The tradition of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him)."

02.0457.1299 : In Surat al-Muzzammil (73), the verse: "Keep vigil at night but a little, a half thereof" (2-3) has been abrogated by the following verse: "He knoweth that ye count it not, and turneth unto you in mercy. Recite then of the Qur'an that which is easy for you" (v.20). The phrase "the vigil of the night" (nashi'at al-layl) means the early hours of the night. They (the companions) would pray (the tahajjud prayer) in the early hours of the night.
02.0457.1299 : He (Ibn Abbas) says: It is advisable to offer the prayer at night (tahajjud), prescribed by Allah for you (in the early hours of the night).

So if one awakes and mentions Allah, a knot will be loosened; if he performs ablution, another knot will be loosened; and if he prays, the third knot will be loosened; and in the morning he will be active and in good spirits; otherwise he will be in bad spirits and sluggish.
02.0458.1302 : Narrated 'A'ishah, Ummul Mu'minin:

Whatever exceeds, that will be reckoned properly."

03.1576 : Muslim ibn Shu'bah said: Nafi' ibn Alqamah appointed my father as charge d'affaires of his tribe, and commanded him to collect sadaqah (zakat) from them. My father sent me to a group of them; so I came to an aged man called Sa'r ibn Disam
03.1576 : I said: My father has sent me to you to collect zakat from you.  He asked: What kind of animals will you take, my nephew?  I replied: We shall select the sheep and examine their udders.  He said: My nephew, I shall narrate a tradition to you. I lived on one of these steppes during the time of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) along with my sheep. Two people riding a camel came to me.
03.1576 : They said to me: We are messengers of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), sent to you so that you may pay the sadaqah (zakat) on your sheep.
03.1576 : I asked: What is due from me for them?
03.1576 : They said: One goat. I went to a goat which I knew was full of milk and fat, and I brought it to them.
03.1576 : They said: This is a pregnant goat. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) prohibited us to accept a pregnant goat.
03.1576 : I asked: What will you take then?  They said: A goat in its second year or a goat in its third year. I then went to a goat which had not given birth to any kid, but it was going to do so. I brought it to them.

(They are:) One who worships Allah alone and one believes that there is no god but Allah; and one who pays the zakat on his property agreeably every year. One should not give an aged animal, nor one suffering from itch or ailing, and one most condemned, but one should give animals of medium quality, for Allah did not demand from you the best of your animals, nor did He command you to give the animals of worst quality.
03.1578 : Narrated Ubayy ibn Ka'b:
03.1578 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) commissioned me as a collector of zakat. I visited a man. When he had collected his property of camels, I found that a she-camel in her second year was due from him.
03.1578 : I said to him: Pay a she-camel in her second year, for she is to be paid as sadaqah (zakat) by you.
03.1578 : He said: That one is not worthy of milking and riding. Here is another she-camel which is young, grand and fat. So take it.
03.1578 : I said to him: I shall not take an animal for which I have not been commanded. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) is here near to you. If you like, go to him, and present to him what you presented to me. Do that; if he accepts it from you, I shall accept it; if he rejects it, I shall reject it.
03.1578 : He said: I shall do it. He accompanied me and took with him the she-camel which he had presented to me. We came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). He said to him: Prophet of Allah, your messenger came to me to collect zakat on my property. By Allah, neither the Apostle of Allah nor his messenger has ever seen my property before. I gathered my property (camels), and he estimated that a she-camel in her second year would be payable by me. But that has neither milk nor is it worth riding. So I presented to him a grand young she-camel for acceptance as  zakat. But he has refused to take her. Look, she is here; I have brought her to you, Apostle of Allah. Take her.
03.1578 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: That is what is due from you. If you give voluntarily a better (animal) Allah will give a reward to you for it. We accept her from you.
03.1578 : She is here, Apostle of Allah; I have brought her to you. So take her. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then ordered me to take possession of it, and he prayed for a blessing on his property.

03.1583 : Narrated Jabir ibn Atik:
03.1583 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Riders who are objects of dislike to you will come to you, but you must welcome them when they come to you, and give them a free hand regarding what they desire. If they are just, they will receive credit for it, but if they are unjust, they will be held responsible. Please them, for the perfection of your zakat consists in their good pleasure, and let them ask a blessing for you .

03.1618 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) prescribed this sadaqah as one sa' of dried dates or barley, or half a sa' of wheat payable by every freeman or slave, male or female, young or old.

03.1625 : As for Uyaynah, he took his document and came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) at his home, and said to him: Muhammad, do you see me?

03.1625 : Thereupon the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: He who begs (from people) when he has sufficient is simply asking for a large amount of Hell-fire. (An-Nufayl (a transmitter) said elsewhere: "embers of Hell".)
03.1625 : They asked: Apostle of Allah, what is a sufficiency? (Elsewhere an-Nufayl said: What is a sufficiency which makes begging unfitting?)
03.1625 : He replied: It is that which would provide a morning and an evening meal. (Elsewhere an-Nufayl said: It is when one has enough for a day and night, or for a night and a day.) He (an-Nufayl) narrated to us this tradition briefly in the words that I have mentioned.

He has divided those entitled to them into eight categories, so if you come within those categories, I shall give you what you desire.
03.1628 : Narrated AbuHurayrah:
03.1628 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said something similar as mentioned in the preceding tradition.

03.1635 : Narrated Samurah ibn Jundub:
03.1635 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Acts of begging are lacerations with which a man disfigures his face, so he who wishes may preserve his self-respect, and he who wishes may abandon it; but this does not apply to one who begs from a ruler, or in a situation which makes it necessary.
03.1637 : Narrated Anas ibn Malik:
03.1637 : A man of the Ansar came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and begged from him.
03.1637 : He (the Prophet) asked: Have you nothing in your house?  He replied: Yes, a piece of cloth, a part of which we wear and a part of which we spread (on the ground), and a wooden bowl from which we drink water.
03.1637 : He said: Bring them to me. He then brought these articles to him and he (the Prophet) took them in his hands and asked: Who will buy these?  A man said: I shall buy them for one dirham.  He said twice or thrice: Who will offer more than one dirham?  A man said: I shall buy them for two dirhams.
03.1637 : He gave these to him and took the two dirhams and, giving them to the Ansari, he said: Buy food with one of them and hand it to your family, and buy an axe and bring it to me. He then brought it to him. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) fixed a handle on it with his own hands and said: Go, gather firewood and sell it, and do not let me see you for a fortnight. The man went away and gathered firewood and sold it. When he had earned ten dirhams, he came to him and bought a garment with some of them and food with the others.
03.1637 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then said: This is better for you than that begging should come as a spot on your face on the Day of Judgment. Begging is right only for three people: one who is in grinding poverty, one who is seriously in debt, or one who is responsible for compensation and finds it difficult to pay.
03.1641 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:
03.1641 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: If one who is afflicted with poverty refers it to me, his poverty will not be brought to an end; but if one refers it to Allah, He will soon give him sufficiency, either by a speedy death or by a sufficiency which comes later.

Umar then said: Allah is most great. He then said to him: Let me inform you about the best a man hoards; it is a virtuous woman who pleases him when he looks at her, obeys him when he gives her a command, and guards his interests when he is away from her.
03.1661 : Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:

The best sadaqah is that which leaves a competence.

04.1766 : He replied: I am aware of it more than the people. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) performed only one hajj. Hence the people differed among themselves.

He then rode (on the she-camel), and when it (the she-camel) stood up, with him on its back, he raised his voice in the talbiyah and some people heard it at that moment. This is because the people were coming in groups, so they heard him raising his voice calling the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and they thought that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back.
04.1766 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) proceeded further; when he ascended the height of al-Bayda' he raised his voice in the talbiyah. Some people heard it at that moment.

I swear by Allah, he raised his voice in the talbiyah at the place where he prayed, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when he ascended the height of al-Bayda'.
04.1766 : Sa'id (ibn Jubayr) said; He who follows the view of Ibn Abbas raises his voice in talbiyah (and ihram) at the place of is prayer after he finishes two rak'ahs of his prayer.

04.1768 : Abdullah ibn Umar replied: As regards the corners, I have not seen the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) touching anything (in the Ka'bah) but the two Yamani corners. As for the tanned leather shoes, I have seen the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) wearing tanned leather shoes, and he would wear them after ablution. Therefore I like to wear them. As regards wearing yellow, I have seen the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) wearing yellow, so I like to wear with it. As regards shouting the talbiyah, I have seen the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) raising his voice in talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on its back.

04.1793 : When Ali returned from the Yemen to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) he said: I found that Fatimah had put on coloured clothes and the smell of the perfume she had used was pervading the house. (He expressed his amazement at the use of coloured clothes and perfume.)
04.1793 : She said: What is wrong with you? The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) has ordered his companions to put off their ihram and they did so.
04.1793 : Ali said: I said to her: I raised my voice in talbiyah for which the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) raised his voice (i.e. I wore ihram for qiran). Then I came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him).

04.1795 : He said: Combine them and sacrifice the animal made easily available for you. I, therefore, raised my voice in talbiyah for both of them (i.e. umrah and hajj). When I reached al-Udhayb, Salman ibn Rabi'ah and Zayd ibn Suhan met me while I was raising my voice in talbiyah for both of them.
04.1795 : One of them said to the other: This (man) does not have any more understanding than his camel. Thereupon it was as if a mountain fell on me.

When I came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), I said: I went to al-Hirah and saw them prostrating themselves before a satrap of theirs, but you have most right, Apostle of Allah, to have (people) prostrating themselves before you. He said: Tell me , if you were to pass my grave, would you prostrate yourself before it? I said: No. He then said: Do not do so. If I were to command anyone to make prostration before another I would command women to prostrate themselves before their husbands, because of the special right over them given to husbands by Allah.
05.2137 : Narrated Mu'awiyah al-Qushayri:
05.2137 : Mu'awiyah asked: Apostle of Allah, what is the right of the wife of one of us over him? He replied: That you should give her food when you eat, clothe her when you clothe yourself, do not strike her on the face, do not revile her or separate yourself from her except in the house.

05.2139 : Narrated Mu'awiyah al-Qushayri:
05.2139 : I went to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and asked him: What do you say (command) about our wives? He replied: Give them food what you have for yourself, and clothe them by which you clothe yourself, and do not beat them, and do not revile them.
05.2141 : Narrated Abdullah ibn AbuDhubab:
05.2141 : Iyas ibn Abdullah ibn AbuDhubab reported the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) as saying: Do not beat Allah's handmaidens, but when Umar came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and said: Women have become emboldened towards their husbands, he (the Prophet) gave permission to beat them. Then many women came round the family of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) complaining against their husbands. So the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Many women have gone round Muhammad's family complaining against their husbands. They are not the best among you.

When he buys a camel, he should take hold of the top of its hump and say the same kind of thing.
05.2157 : Narrated AbuHurayrah:
05.2157 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: He who has intercourse with his wife through her anus is accursed.
05.2159 : Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:
05.2159 : Ibn Umar misunderstood (the Qur'anic verse, "So come to your tilth however you will")--may Allah forgive him. The fact is that this clan of the Ansar, who were idolaters, lived in the company of the Jews who were the people of the Book. They (the Ansar) accepted their superiority over themselves in respect of knowledge, and they followed most of their actions. The people of the Book (i.e. the Jews) used to have intercourse with their women on one side alone (i.e. lying on their backs). This was the most concealing position for (the vagina of) the women. This clan of the Ansar adopted this practice from them. But this tribe of the Quraysh used to uncover their women completely, and seek pleasure with them from in front and behind and laying them on their backs.
05.2159 : When the muhajirun (the immigrants) came to Medina, a man married a woman of the Ansar. He began to do the same kind of action with her, but she disliked it, and said to him: We were approached on one side (i.e. lying on the back); do it so, otherwise keep away from me. This matter of theirs spread widely, and it reached the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him).
05.2159 : So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur'anic verse: "Your wives are a tilth to you, so come to your tilth however you will," i.e. from in front, from behind or lying on the back. But this verse meant the place of the delivery of the child, i.e. the vagina.
05.2161 : Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
05.2161 : I and the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to lie in one cloth at night while I was menstruating. If anything from me smeared him, he washed the same place (that was smeared), and did not wash beyond it. If anything from him smeared his clothe, he washed the same place and did not wash beyond that, and prayed with it (i.e. the clothe).
05.2163 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:

05.2166 : A man said: Apostle of Allah, I have a slave-girl and I withdraw the penis from her (while having intercourse), and I dislike that she becomes pregnant. I intend (by intercourse) what the men intend by it.
05.2166 : The Jews say that withdrawing the penis (azl) is burying the living girls on a small scale. He (the Prophet) said: The Jews told a lie. If Allah intends to create it, you cannot turn it away.
05.2169 : Narrated Abu Hurairah:
05.2169 : Abu Nadrah reported: An old man of Tufawah said to me: I was a guest of Abu Hurairah at Medina. I did not find any one of the companions of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) more devoted to worship and more hospitable than Abu Hurairah.
05.2169 : One day I was with him when he was sitting on his bed. He had a purse which contained pebbles or kernels. A black slave-girl of his was sitting below. Counting them he was glorifying Allah. When the pebbles or the kernels in the purse were finished, she gathered them and put them again in the purse, and gave it to him. He said: Should I not tell you about me and about the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)?
05.2169 : I said: Yes.  He said: Once when I was laid up with fever in the mosque, the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came and entered the mosque, and said: Who saw the youth of ad-Daws. He said this three times.
05.2169 : A man said: Apostle of Allah, there he is, laid up with fever on one side of the mosque. He moved, walking forward till he reached me. He placed his hand on me. He had a kind talk with me, and I rose. He then began to walk till he reached the place where he used to offer his prayer. He paid his attention to the people. There were two rows of men and one row of women, or two rows of women and one row of men (the narrator is doubtful).
05.2169 : He then said: If Satan makes me forget anything during the prayer, the men should glorify Allah, and the women should clap their hands. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then prayed and he did not forget anything during the prayer.
05.2169 : He said: Be seated in your places, be seated in your places. The narrator, Musa, added the word "here". He then praised Allah and exalted Him, and said: Now to our topic.

05.2169 : They replied: Yes.  He said: later he sits and says: I did so-and-so; I did so-and-so. The people kept silence. He then turned to the women and said (to them): Is there any woman among you who narrates it? They kept silence. Then a girl fell on one of her knees. The narrator, Mu'ammil, said in his version: a buxom girl. She raised her head before the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) so that he could see her and listen to her.
05.2169 : She said: Apostle of Allah, they (the men) describe the secrets (of intercourse) and they (the women) also describe the secrets (of intercourse) to the people.
05.2169 : He said: Do you know what the similitude is? He said: The likeness of this act is the likeness of a female Satan who meets the male Satan on the roadside; he fulfils his desire with her while the people are looking at him. Beware! The perfume of men is that whose smell becomes visible and its colour does not appear. Beware! The perfume of women is that whose colour becomes visible and whose smell is not obvious.
05.2169 : Abu Dawud said: From here I remembered this tradition from Mu'ammil and Musa: Beware! No man should lie with another man, no woman should lie with another woman except with one's child or father. He also mentioned a third which I have forgotten. This has been mentioned in the version of Musaddad, but I do not remember it as precisely as I like.

06.2247A: He said: I swear by Allah. Allah will not punish me for this (act), as He did not cause me to be flogged for this (act). So he bore witness a fifth time invoking the curse of Allah on him if he was one of those who told lies.
06.2247A: Then the people said to her: Testify. So she gave testimony before Allah that he was a liar.
06.2247A: When she was going to testify a fifth time, she was told: Fear Allah, for the punishment in this world is easier than that in the next world. This is the deciding one that will surely cause punishment to you.
06.2247A: She hesitated for a moment, and then said: By Allah, I shall not disgrace my people. So she testified a fifth time invoking the curse of Allah on her if he spoke the truth.
06.2247A: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) separated them from each other, and decided that the child would not be attributed to its father. Neither she nor her child would be accused of adultery. He who accused her or her child would be liable to punishment. He also decided that there would be no dwelling and maintenance for her (from the husband), as they were separated without divorce.
06.2247A: He then said: If she gives birth to a child with reddish hair, light buttocks, wide belly and light shins, he will be the child of Hilal. If she bears a dusky child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttock he will be the child of the one who was accused of adultery. She gave birth to a dusky child with curly hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttocks.
06.2247A: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Had there been no oaths I should have dealt with her severely.
06.2247A: Ikrimah said: Later on he became the chief of the tribe of Mudar. He was not attributed to his father.
06.2255 : Narrated AbuHurayrah:
06.2255 : A bedouin came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), and said: My wife has given birth to a black son, and I disown him. He then narrated the rest of the tradition to the same effect.
06.2256 : Narrated AbuHurayrah:
06.2256 : AbuHurayrah heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say when the verse about invoking curses came down: Any woman who brings to her family one who does not belong to it has nothing to do with Allah (i.e. expects no mercy from Allah), and Allah will not bring her into His Paradise.
06.2256 : Allah, the Exalted, will veil Himself from any man who disowns his child when he looks at him, and disgrace him in the presence of all creatures, first and last.
06.2257 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
06.2257 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: There is no prostitution in Islam. If anyone practised prostitution in pre-Islamic times, the child will be attributed to the master (of the slave-woman). He who claims his child without a valid marriage or ownership will neither inherit nor be inherited.
06.2258 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:
06.2258 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) decided regarding one who was treated as a member of a family after the death of his father, to whom he was attributed when the heirs said he was one of them, that if he was the child of a slave-woman whom the father owned when he had intercourse with her, he was included among those who sought his inclusion, but received none of the inheritance which was previously divided; he, however, received his portion of the inheritance which had not already been divided; but if the father to whom he was attributed had disowned him, he was not joined to the heirs.
06.2258 : If he was a child of a slave-woman whom the father did not possess or of a free woman with whom he had illicit intercourse, he was not joined to the heirs and did not inherit even if the one to whom he was attributed is the one who claimed paternity, since he was a child of fornication whether his mother was free or a slave.
06.2260 : Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
06.2260 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) entered  upon me. The version of Musaddad and Ibn as-Sarh has: one day looking pleased". The version of Uthman has: "The lines of his forehead were realised." He said: O Aisha, are you not surprised to hear that Mujazziz al-Mudlaji saw that Zayd and Usamah had a rug over them concerning their heads and letting their feet appear. He said: These feet are related.
06.2262 : Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam:
06.2262 : I was sitting with the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). A man came from the Yemen, and said: Three men from the people of the Yemen came to Ali, quarrelling about a child, asking him to give a decision. They had had sexual intercourse with a woman during a single state of purity.
06.2262 : He said to two of them: Give this child to this man (the third person) with pleasure. But they (refused and) cried loudly. Again he said to two of them: Give the child to the man (the third person) willingly. But they (refused and) cried loudly. He then said: You are quarrelsome partners. I shall cast lots among you; he who receives the lot, will acquire the child, and he shall pay two-thirds of the blood-money to both his companions. He then cast lots among them, and gave the child to the one who received the lot. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) laughed so much that his canine or molar teeth appeared.
06.2263 : Narrated Zayd ibn Arqam:
06.2263 : Three persons were brought to Ali (Allah be pleased with him) when he was in the Yemen. They and sexual intercourse with a woman during a single state of purity. He asked two of them: Do you acknowledge this child for this (man)? They replied: No. He then put this (question) to all of them. Whenever he asked two of them, they replied in the negative. He, therefore, cast a lot among them, and attributed the child to the one who received the lot. He imposed two-third of the blood-money (i.e. the price of the mother) on him. This was then mentioned to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and he laughed so much that his molar teeth appeared.
06.2267 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:
06.2267 : A man got up and said: Apostle of Allah, so-and-so is my son; I had illicit intercourse with his mother in the pre-Islamic period. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: There is no unlawful claiming of paternity in Islam. What was done in pre-Islamic times has been annulled. The child is attributed to the one on whose bed it is born, and the fornicator is deprived of any right.
06.2268 : Narrated Uthman ibn Affan:
06.2268 : Rabah said: My people married me to a Roman slave-girl of theirs. I had intercourse with her, and she gave birth to a black (male) child like me. I named it Abdullah. I again had intercourse with her, and she gave birth to a black (male) child like me. I named it Ubaydullah. Then a Roman slave of my people, called Yuhannah, incited her, and spoke to her in his own unintelligible language. She gave birth to a son like a chameleon (red).
06.2268 : I asked her: What is this?  She replied: This belongs to Yuhannah. We then brought the case to Uthman (for a decision). I think Mahdi said these words. He inquired from both of them, and they acknowledged (the facts).
06.2268 : He then said to them: Do you agree that I take the decision about you, which the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had taken? The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) decided that the child was to attributed to the one on whose bed it was born. And I think he said: He flogged her and flogged him, for they were slaves.
06.2269 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:
06.2269 : A woman said: Apostle of Allah, my womb is a vessel to this son of mine, my breasts, a water-skin for him, and my lap a guard for him, yet his father has divorced me, and wants to take him away from me. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: You have more right to him as long as you do not marry.
06.2270 : Narrated AbuHurayrah:
06.2270 : Hilal ibn Usamah quoted AbuMaymunah Salma, client of the people of Medina, as saying: While I was sitting with AbuHurayrah, a Persian woman came to him along with a son of hers. She had been divorced by her husband and they both claimed him.
06.2270 : She said: AbuHurayrah, speaking to him in Persian, my husband wishes to take my son away.
06.2270 : AbuHurayrah said: Cast lots for him, saying it to her in a foreign language.
06.2270 : Then her husband came and asked: Who is disputing with me about my son?
06.2270 : AbuHurayrah said: O Allah, I do not say this, except that I heard a woman who came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) while I was sitting with him, and she said: My husband wishes to take away my son, Apostle of Allah, and he draws water for me from the well of AbuInabah, and he has been good to me.
06.2270 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Cast lots for him.  Her husband said: Who is disputing with me about my son?  The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: This is your father and this your mother, so take whichever of them you wish by the hand. So he took his mother's hand and she went away with him.
06.2271 : Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:
06.2271 : Zayd ibn Harithah went out to Mecca and brought the daughter of Hamzah with him. Then Ja'far said: I shall take her; I have more right to her; she is my uncle's daughter and her maternal aunt is my wife; the maternal aunt is like mother. Ali said: I am more entitled to take her. She is my uncle's daughter. The daughter of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) is my wife, and she has more right to her. Zayd said: I have more right to her. I went out and journeyed to her, and brought her with me. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) came out.
06.2271 : The narrator mentioned the rest of the tradition. He (i.e. the Prophet) said: As for the girl, I decided in favour of Ja'far. She will live with her maternal aunt. The maternal aunt is like mother.
06.2273 : Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:
06.2273 : When we came out from Mecca, Hamzah's daughter pursued us crying: My uncle. Ali lifted her and took her by the hand. (Addressing Fatimah he said:) Take your uncle's daughter. She then lifted her. The narrator then transmitted the rest of the tradition. Ja'far said: She is my uncle's daughter. Her maternal aunt is my wife. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) decided in favour of her maternal aunt, and said: The maternal aunt is like mother.
06.2274 : Narrated Asma bint Yazid al-Ansariyyah:
06.2274 : Amr ibn Muhajir reported on the authority of his father: Asma', daughter of Yazid ibn as-Sakan al-Ansariyyah, was divorced in the time of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). No waiting period was prescribed for a divorced woman (at that time). When Asma' was divorced, Allah, the Exalted, sent down the injunction of waiting period for divorce. She is the first of the divorced women about whom the verse relating to waiting period was sent down.
06.2275 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
06.2275 : Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart, three monthly courses; and then said: And for such of your women as despair of menstruation, if ye doubt, their period (of waiting) shall be three months. This was abrogated from the former verse. Again he said: (O ye who believe, if ye wed believing women) and divorce them before ye have touched them, then there is no period that ye should reckon."
06.2276 : Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:
06.2276 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) divorced Hafsah, but he took her back in marriage.

She said that she came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and sought his opinion about her going out from her house. He commanded her to shift to (the house of )Ibn Umm Maktum who was blind. Marwan denied to confirm the tradition of Fatimah about the going out of a divorced woman from her house. Urwah said: Aisha objected to Fatimah daughter of Qays.
06.2285 : Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
06.2285 : Urwah said: Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) severely objected to the tradition of Fatimah daughter of Qays. She said: Fatimah lived in a desolate house and she feared for her loneliness there. Hence the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) accorded permission to her (to leave the place).
06.2286 : Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
06.2286 : Urwah ibn az-Zubayr said: Aisha was asked: Did you not see (i.e. known) the statement of Fatimah? She replied: It is not good for her to mention it (to others).
06.2288 : Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
06.2288 : Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad and Sulayman ibn Yasar reported: Yahya ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As divorced the daughter of AbdurRahman ibn al-Hakam absolutely. AbdurRahman shifted her (from there). Aisha sent a message to Marwan ibn al-Hakam who was the governor of Medina, and said to him: Fear Allah, and return the woman to her home. Marwan said (according to Sulayman's version): AbdurRahman forced me. Marwan said (according to the version of al-Qasim): Did not the case of Fatimah daughter of Qays reach you? Aisha replied: There would be no harm to you if you did not make mention of the tradition of Fatimah. Marwan said: If you think that it was due to some evil (i.e. reason), then it is sufficient for you to see that there is also an evil between the two.
06.2292 : Narrated Umm Salamah ; Umm Habibah ; Zaynab bint Jahsh:
06.2292 : Humayd ibn Nafi' reported the following three traditions on the authority of Zaynab, daughter of AbuSalamah:
06.2292 : Zaynab said: I visited Umm Habibah when her father AbuSufyan, died. She asked for some yellow perfume containing saffron (khaluq) or something else. Then she applied it to a girl and touched her cheeks.
06.2292 : She said: I have no need of perfume, but I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to observe mourning for one who has died, more than three nights, except for four months and ten days in the case of a husband.
06.2292 : Zaynab said: I also visited Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, when her brother died. She asked for some perfume and used it upon herself.
06.2292 : She then said: I have no need of perfume, but I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say when he was on the pulpit: It is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to observe mourning for one who has died, more than three nights, except for four months and ten days in the case of a husband.
06.2292 : Zaynab said: I heard my mother, Umm Salamah, say: A woman came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and said: Apostle of Allah, the husband of my daughter has died, and she is suffering from sore eyes; may we put antimony in her eyes?
06.2292 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: No. He said this twice or thrice. Each time he said: No. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: The waiting period is now four months and ten days. In pre-Islamic days one of you used to throw away a piece of dung at the end of a year.
06.2292 : Humayd said: I asked Zaynab: What do you mean by throwing away a piece of dung at the end of a year.
06.2292 : Zaynab replied: When the husband of a woman died, she entered a small cell and put on shabby clothes, not touching perfume or any other thing until a year passed. Then an animal such as donkey or sheep or bird was provided for her. She rubbed herself with it. The animal with which she rubbed herself rarely survived. She then came out and was given a piece of dung which she threw away. She then used perfume or something else which she desired.
06.2293 : Narrated Furay'ah, daughter of Malik ibn Sinan:
06.2293 : Zaynab, daughter of Ka'b ibn Ujrah narrated that Furay'ah daughter of Malik ibn Sinan, told her that she came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and asked him whether she could return to her people, Banu Khidrah, for her husband went out seeking his slaves who ran away. When they met him at al-Qudum, they murdered him.
06.2293 : So I asked the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him): "Should I return to my people, for he did not leave any dwelling house of his own and maintenance for me?
06.2293 : She said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) replied: Yes.  She said: I came out, and when I was in the apartment or in the mosque, he called for me, or he commanded (someone to call me) and, therefore, I was called.
06.2293 : He said: what did you say? So I repeated my story which I had already mentioned about my husband. Thereupon he said: Stay in your house till the term lapses. She said:
06.2293 : So I passed my waiting period in it (her house) for four months and ten days. When Uthman ibn Affan became caliph, he sent for me and asked me about that; so I informed him, and he followed it and decided cases accordingly.
06.2297 : Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:
06.2297 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: A woman whose husband has died must not wear clothes dyed with safflower (usfur) or with red ochre (mishq) and ornaments. She must not apply henna and collyrium.
06.2298 : Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu'minin:
06.2298 : Umm Hakim, daughter of Usayd, reported on the authority of her mother that her husband died and she was suffering from sore eyes. She therefore applied collyrium (jala'). Ahmad said: The correct version is "glittering collyrium (kuhl al-jala'). She sent her slave-girl to Umm Salamah, and she asked her about the use of glittering collyrium (kuhl al-jala').
06.2298 : She said: Do not apply it except in the case of dire need which is troubling you. In that case you can use it at night, but you should remove it in the daytime. Then Umm Salamah said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came to visit me when AbuSalamah died, and I had put the juice of aloes in my eye.
06.2298 : He asked : What is this, Umm Salamah?  I replied: It is only the juice of aloes and contains no perfume.  He said: It gives the face a glow, so apply it only at night and remove it in daytime, and do not comb yourself with scent or henna, for it is a dye.  I asked: What should I use when I comb myself, Apostle of Allah?  He said: Use lote-tree leaves and smear your head copiously with them.
06.2300 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:
06.2300 : I can invoke the curse of Allah on anyone who wishes: The smaller surat an-Nisa (i.e. Surat at-Talaq) was revealed after the verse regarding the waiting period of four months and ten days had been revealed.
06.2301 : Narrated Amr ibn al-'As:
06.2301 : Do not confuse us about his Sunnah. Ibn al-Muthanna said: The Sunnah of our Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) is that the waiting period of a slave-mother whose husband has died is four months and ten days.
06.2302 : Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
06.2302 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife three times, and she married another who entered upon her, but divorced her before having intercourse with her, whether she was lawful for the former husband. She said: The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) replied: She is not lawful for the first (husband) until she tastes the honey of the other husband and he tastes her honey.
06.2304 : Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:
06.2304 : Musaykah, a slave-girl of some Ansari, came and said: My master forces me to commit fornication. Thereupon the following verse was revealed: "But force not your maids to prostitution (when they desire chastity)."
07.2306 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
07.2306 : Ibn Abbas explained the following Qur'anic verse: "O ye who believe! fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you" During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), when the people offered night prayer, they were asked to abstain from food and drink and (intercourse with) women, they kept fast till the next night. A man betrayed himself and had intercourse with his wife after he had offered the night prayer, and he did not break his fast. So Allah, the Exalted, intended to make it (fasting) easy for those who survived,  thus providing a concession and utility. Allah, the Glorified, said: "Allah knoweth what ye used to do secretly among yourselves." By this Allah benefited the people and provided concession and ease to them.
07.2311 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
07.2311 : Explaining the verse; "For those who can do it (with hard-ship) is a ransom, the feeding of one, that is indigent," he said: This was a concession granted to the aged man and woman who were able to keep fast; they were allowed to leave the fast and instead feed an indigent person for each fast; (and a concession) to pregnant and suckling woman when they apprehended harm (to themselves).
07.2312 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:
07.2312 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The month consists of twenty-nine days, but do not fast till you sight it (the moon) and do not break your fast till you sight it. If the weather is cloudy, calculate it thirty days. When the twenty-ninth of Sha'ban came, Ibn Umar would send someone (who tried) to sight the moon for him. If it was sighted, then well and good; in case it was not sighted, and there was no cloud and dust before him (on the horizon), he would not keep fast the next day. If there appeared (on the horizon) before him cloud or dust, he would fast the following day. Ibn Umar would end his fasting alone with the people, and did not follow this calculation.
07.2315 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:
07.2315 : We kept fast for twenty-nine days along with the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) more often than we kept fast for thirty days.
07.2317 : Narrated AbuHurayrah:
07.2317 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The end of Ramadan is on the day when you end it, and the 'Id (festival) of sacrifice is on the day when you sacrifice. The whole of Arafah is the place of staying, and the whole of Mina is the place of sacrifice, and all the roads of Mecca are the place of sacrifice, and the whole of Muzdalifah is the place of staying.
07.2318 : Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
07.2318 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to count the days in Sha'ban in a manner he did not count any other month; then he fasted when he sighted the new moon of Ramadan; but if the weather was cloudy he counted thirty days and then fasted.
07.2319 : Narrated Hudhayfah:
07.2319 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do not fast (for Ramadan) before the coming of the month until you sight the moon or complete the number (of thirty days); then fast until you sight the moon or complete the number (of thirty days).
07.2320 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
07.2320 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do not fast one day or two days just before Ramadan except in the case of a man who has been in the habit or observing a fast (on that day); and do not fast until you sight it (the moon). Then fast until you sight it. If a cloud appears on that day (i.e. 29th of Ramadan) then complete the number thirty (days) and then end the fasting: a month consists of twenty-nine days.
07.2322 : Narrated Mu'awiyah:
07.2322 : AbulAzhar al-Mughirah ibn Farwah said: Mu'awiyah stood among the people at Dayr Mustahill lying at the gate of Hims. He said: O people, we sighted the moon on such-and-such day. We shall fast in advance. Anyone who likes to do so may do it. Malik ibn Hubayrah as-Saba'i stood up and asked: Mu'awiyah, did you hear the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say something (about this matter), or is this something on the basis of your opinion? He replied: I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) as saying: Fast the month (in the beginning) and in the last.
07.2327 : Narrated Ammar:
07.2327 : AbuIshaq reported on the authority of Silah: We were with Ammar on the day when the appearance of the moon was doubtful. (The meat of) goat was brought to him.

07.2330 : AbdulAziz ibn  Muhammad said: Abbad ibn Kathir came to Medina and went to the assembly of al-Ala'. He caught hold of his hand and made him stand and said: O Allah, he narrates a tradition from his father on the authority of AbuHurayrah who reported the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) as saying: When the middle of Sha'ban comes, do not fast. Al-Ala' said: O Allah, my father narrated this tradition on the authority of AbuHurayrah from the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him)
07.2331 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:
07.2331 : Husayn ibn al-Harith al-Jadli from the tribe of Jadilah Qays said: The governor of Mecca delivered a speech and said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) took a pledge from us that we should perform the rites of hajj after sighting the moon. If we do not sight it and two reliable persons bear witness, we should perform the rites of hajj on the basis of their witness.
07.2331 : I then asked al-Husayn ibn al-Harith: Who was the governor of Mecca?  He replied: I do not know. He then met me later on and told me: He was al-Harith ibn Hatib, brother of Muhammad ibn Hatib. The governor then said: There is among you a man who is more acquainted with Allah and His Apostle than I. He witnessed this from the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). He then pointed with his hand to a man. Al-Husayn said: I asked an old man beside me: Who is that man to whom the governor has alluded?
07.2331 : He said: "This is Abdullah ibn Umar, and he spoke the truth. He was more acquainted with Allah than he. He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: For this is what the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) commanded us (to do).

07.2334 : Narrated Ikrimah:
07.2334 : Once the people doubted the appearance of the moon of Ramadan, and intended neither to offer the tarawih prayer nor to keep fast. A bedouin came from al-Harrah and testified that he had sighted the moon. He was brought to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). He asked: Do you testify that there is no god but Allah, and that I am the Apostle of Allah? He said: Yes; and he testified that he had sighted the moon. He commanded Bilal who announced to the people to offer the tarawih prayer and to keep fast.
07.2335 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:

'Umar b. al-Khattab copied for me a document about the religious endowment (waqf) made by 'Umar al-Khattab: In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is what allah's servant 'Umar has written about Thamgh. He narrated the tradition like the one transmitted by Nafi'. He added: "provided he is not storing up goods (for himself)." The surplus fruit will be devoted to the beggar and the deprived. He then went on with the tradition, saying: If the man in charge of Thamgh wishes to buy a slave for his work for its fruits (by selling them), he may do so. Mu'iqb penned it and 'Abd Allah b. al-Arqam witnessed it: In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. this is what Allah's servant 'Umar, Commander of the Faithful, directed, in casesome incident happens to him (i.e. he dies), that Thamgh, Sirmah b. al-Akwa', the servant who is there, the hundred shares in (the land of) Khaibar, the servant who is there and the hundred shares which Muhammad (peace_be_upon_him) had donated to me in the valley (nearly) will remain in the custody of Hafsah during her life, then the men of opinion from her family will be in charge of these (endowments), that these will neither be sold nor purchased, spending (its produce) where they think (necessary on the beggar, deprived and relatives).

He, therefore, came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and said: Apostle of Allah, my father left in his will that a hundred slaves should be emancipated on his behalf and Hisham has emancipated fifty on his behalf and fifty remain.

So the man came to him and informed him about their opinion. He said: I would then be in error and not those who are rightly guided. But I decide concerning the matter as the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) did: the daughter gets half, and the son's daughter gets a share which complete two thirds (i.e. gets a sixth), and what remains goes to the full sister.

What do you think, Apostle of Allah? They cannot be married unless they have some property. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Allah will decide regarding the matter. Then the verse of Surat an-Nisa was revealed: "Allah (thus) directs you as regards your children's (inheritance)." Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Call to me the woman and her husband's brother. He then said to their paternal uncle: Give them two-thirds and their mother an eighth, and what remains is yours.

He then questioned the people, and al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said: I had been present with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) when he gave grandmother a sixth. Abu Bakr said: Is there anyone with you? Muhammad ibn Maslamah stood and said the same as al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah had said. So Abu Bakr made it apply to her. Another grandmother came to Umar ibn al-Khattab asking him for her share of inheritance. He said: Nothing has been prescribed for you in Allah's Book. The decision made before you was made for a grandmother other than you. I am not going to add in the shares of inheritance; but it is that sixth.

He asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam, and they embraced Islam. He divided the camels among them. But it occurred to him then that he should withdraw his camels from them. Is he more entitled to them or we? If he says: Yes or no, then tell him: My father is an old man, and he is the chief of the people living at the water. He has requested you to make me chief after him.
13.2928 : He came to him and said: My father has extended his greetings to you.  He replied: On you and you father be peace.  He said: My father asked his people to give them one hundred camels if they embraced Islam. So they embraced Islam, and their belief in Islam is good. Then it occurred to him that he should take his camels back from them. Is he more entitled to them or are they?
13.2928 : He said: If he likes to give them the camels, he may give them; and if he likes to take them back, he is more entitled to them than his people. If they embraced Islam, then for them is their Islam. If they do not embrace Islam, they will be fought against in the cause of Islam.
13.2928 : He said: My father is an old man; he is the chief of the people living at the spring. He has asked you to appoint me chief after him.

He said: If it is so, I will not go. He said: Then I do not force you.
13.2942 : Narrated AbuMaryam al-Azdi:
13.2942 : When I entered upon Mu'awiyah, he said: How good your visit is to us, O father of so-and-so. (This is an idiom used by the Arabs on such occasions). I said: I tell you a tradition which I heard (from the Prophet). I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: If Allah puts anyone in the position of authority over the affairs of the Muslims, and he secludes himself (from them), not fulfilling their needs, wants, and poverty, Allah will keep Himself away from him, not fulfilling his need, want and poverty. He said: He (Mu'awiyah) appointed a man to fulfil the needs of the people.
13.2943 : Narrated AbuHurayrah:
13.2943 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: It is not on my own that I give you or withhold from you: I am just a treasure, putting it where I have been commanded.
13.2944 : Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:
13.2944 : Malik ibn Aws ibn al-Hadthan said: One day Umar ibn al-Khattab mentioned the spoils of war and said: I am not more entitled to this spoil of war than you; and none of us is more entitled to it than another, except that we occupy our positions fixed by the Book of Allah, Who is Great and Glorious, and the division made by the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), people being arranged according to their precedence in accepting Islam, the hardship they have endured their having children and their need.
13.2945 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:
13.2945 : Zayd ibn Aslam said: Abdullah ibn Umar entered upon Mu'awiyah. He asked: (Tell me) your need, AbuAbdurRahman. He replied: Give (the spoils) to those who were set free, for I saw the first thing the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) did when anything came to him was to give something to those who had been set free.
13.2946 : Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
13.2946 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) was brought a pouch  containing bead and divided it among free women and slave women. Aisha said: My father used to divide things between free men and slave.
13.2948 : Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:
13.2948 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: I am nearer to the believers than themselves, so if anyone leaves property, it goes to his heirs, and if anyone leaves debt and dependants, let the matter come to me and I shall be responsible.
13.2952 : Narrated A man:
13.2952 : Sulaym ibn Mutayr reported on the authority of his father that Mutayr went away to perform hajj.
13.2952 : When he reached as-Suwaida', a man suddenly came searching for medicine and ammonium anthorhizum extract, and he said: A man who heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) addressing the people commanding and prohibiting them, told me that he said: O people, accept presents so long as they remain presents; but when the Quraysh quarrel about the rule, and the presents are given for the religion of one of you, then leave them alone.
13.2953 : Narrated Dhul-Zawa'id:
13.2953 : Mutayr said: I heard a man say: I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) in the Farewell Pilgrimage. He was commanding and prohibiting them (the people). He said: O Allah, did I give full information? They said: Yes. He said: When the Quraysh quarrel about the rule among themselves, and the presents become bribery, them leave them. The people were asked: Who was he (who narrated this tradition)? They said: This was Dhul-Zawa'id, a Companion of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him).
13.2955 : Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:
13.2955 : A son of Adi ibn Adi al-Kindi said that Umar ibn AbdulAziz wrote (to his governors): If anyone asks about the places where spoils (fay') should be spent, that should be done in accordance with the decision made by Umar ibn al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him). The believers considered him to be just, according to the saying of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him): Allah has placed truth upon Umar's tongue and heart. He fixed stipends for Muslims, and provided protection for the people of other religions by levying jizyah (poll-tax) on them, deducting no fifth from it, nor taking  it as booty.
13.2956 : Narrated AbuDharr:
13.2956 : I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: Allah, the Exalted, has placed truth on Umar's tongue and he speaks it.
13.2961 : Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:
13.2961 : Malik ibn Aws al-Hadthan said: One of the arguments put forward by Umar was that he said that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) received three things exclusively to himself: Banu an-Nadir, Khaybar and Fadak. The Banu an-Nadir property was kept wholly for his emergent needs, Fadak for travellers, and Khaybar was divided by the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) into three sections: two for Muslims, and one as a contribution for his family. If anything remained after making the contribution of his family, he divided it among the poor Emigrants.
13.2963 : Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
13.2963 : Fatimah was demanding (the property of) sadaqah of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) at Medina and Fadak, and what remained from the fifth of Khaybar. Aisha quoted AbuBakr as saying: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: We are not inherited; whatever we leave is sadaqah. The family of Muhammad will eat from this property, that is, from the property of Allah. They will not take more then their sustenance.
13.2966 : Narrated Umar ibn AbdulAziz:
13.2966 : Al-Mughirah (ibn Shu'bah) said: Umar ibn AbdulAziz gathered the family of Marwan when he was made caliph, and he said: Fadak belonged to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), and he made contributions from it, showing repeated kindness to the poor of the Banu Hashim from it, and supplying from it the cost of marriage for those who were unmarried. Fatimah asked him to give it to her, but he refused. That is how matters stood during the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) till he passed on (i.e. died).
13.2966 : When AbuBakr was made ruler he administered it as the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) had done in his lifetime till he passed on. Then when Umar ibn al-Khattab was made ruler he administered it as they had done till he passed on. Then it was given to Marwan as a fief, and it afterwards came to Umar ibn AbdulAziz.
13.2966 : Umar ibn AbdulAziz said: I consider I have no right to something which the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) refused to Fatimah, and I call you to witness that I have restored it to its former condition; meaning in the time of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him).
13.2967 : Narrated AbuBakr:
13.2967 : AbutTufayl said: Fatimah came to AbuBakr asking him for the inheritance of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). AbuBakr said: I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: If Allah, Most High, gives a Prophet some means of sustenance, that goes to his successor.
13.2969 : Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:
13.2969 : AbulBakhtari said: I heard from a man a tradition which I liked. I said to him: Write it down for me. So he brought it clearly written to me.
13.2969 : (It says): Al-Abbas and Ali entered upon Umar when Talhah, az-Zubayr, AbdurRahman and Sa'd were with him. They (Abbas and Ali) were disputing.
13.2969 : Umar said to Talhah, az-Zubayr, AbdurRahman and Sa'd: Do you not know that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: All the property of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) is sadaqah (alms), except what he provided for his family for their sustenance and their clothing. We are not to be inherited.
13.2969 : They said: Yes, indeed.  He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to spend from his property on his family, and give the residue as sadaqah (alms). The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then died, and AbuBakr ruled for two years. He would deal with it in the same manner as the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) did. He then mentioned a little from the tradition of Malik ibn Aws.
13.2976 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
13.2976 : Yazid ibn Hurmuz said that when Najdah al-Haruri performed hajj during the rule of Ibn az-Zubayr, he sent someone to Ibn Abbas to ask him about the portion of the relatives (in the fifth). He asked: For whom do you think?  Ibn Abbas replied: For the relatives of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) divided it among them. Umar presented it to us but we found it less than our right. We, therefore returned it to him and refused to accept it.
13.2978 : Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:
13.2978 : I, al-Abbas, Fatimah and Zayd ibn Harithah gathered with the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and I said: Apostle of Allah, if you think to assign us our right (portion) in this fifth ( of the booty) as mentioned in the Book of Allah, and this I may divide during your lifetime so that no one may dispute me after you, then do it. He said: He did that. He said: I divided it during the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). AbuBakr then assigned it to me. During the last days of the caliphate of Umar a good deal of property came to him and took out our portion. I said to him: We are well to do this year; but the Muslims are needy, so return it to them. He, therefore, returned it to them. No one called me after Umar. I met al-Abbas when I came out from Umar. He said: Ali, today you have deprived us of a thing that will never be returned to us. He was indeed a man of wisdom.
13.2979 : Narrated AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith:
13.2979 : AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith said that his father, Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith, and Abbas ibn al-Muttalib said to AbdulMuttalib ibn Rabi'ah and al-Fadl ibn Abbas: Go to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and tell him: Apostle of Allah, we are now of age as you see, and we wish to marry. Apostle of Allah, you are the kindest of the people and the most skilled in matchmaking. Our fathers have nothing with which to pay our dower. So appoint us collector of sadaqah (zakat), Apostle of Allah, and we shall give you what the other collectors give you, and we shall have the benefit accruing from it. Ali came to us while we were in this condition.
13.2979 : He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: No, I swear by Allah, he will not appoint any of you collector of sadaqah (zakat).
13.2979 : Rabi'ah said to him: This is your condition; you have gained your relationship with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) by marriage, but we did not grudge you that. Ali then put his cloak on the earth and lay on it.
13.2979 : He then said: I am the father of Hasan, the chief. I swear by Allah, I shall not leave this place until your sons come with a reply (to the question) for which you have sent them to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him).
13.2979 : AbdulMuttalib said: So I and al-Fadl went towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). We found that the noon prayer in congregation had already started. So we prayed along with the people. I and al-Fadl then hastened towards the door of the apartment of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). He was (staying) with Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh, that day. We stood until the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) came. He caught my ear and the ear of al-Fadl.
13.2979 : He then said: Reveal what you conceal in your hearts. He then entered  and permitted me and al-Fadl (to enter). So we entered and for a little while we asked each other to talk. I then talked to him, or al-Fadl talked to him (the narrator, Abdullah was not sure).
13.2979 : He said: He spoke to him concerning the matter about which our fathers ordered us to ask him. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) remained silent for a moment and raised his eyes towards the ceiling of the room. He took so long that we thought he would not give any reply to us. Meanwhile we saw that Zaynab was signalling to us with her hand from behind the veil, asking us not to be in a hurry, and that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was (thinking) about our matter.
13.2979 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then lowered his head and said to us: This sadaqah (zakat) is a dirt of the people. It is legal neither for Muhammad nor for the family of Muhammad. Call Nawfal ibn al-Harith to me. So Nawfal ibn al-Harith was called to him.
13.2979 : He said: Nawfal, marry AbdulMuttalib (to your daughter). So Nawfal married me (to his daughter).
13.2979 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) then said: Call Mahmiyyah ibn Jaz'i to me. He was a man of Banu Zubayd, whom the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had appointed collector of the fifths.
13.2979 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to Mahmiyyah: Marry al-Fadl (to your daughter). So he married him to her. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Stand up and pay the dower from the fifth so-and-so on their behalf. Abdullah ibn al-Harith did not name it (i.e. the amount of the dower).
13.2984 : Narrated Mujja'ah ibn Mirarah al-Yamani:
13.2984 : Mujja'ah went to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) asking him for the blood-money of his brother whom Banu Sadus from Banu Dhuhl had killed.
13.2984 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Had I appointed blood-money for a polytheist, I should have appointed it for your brother. But I shall give you compensation for him. So the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) wrote (a document) for him that he should be given a hundred camels which were to be acquired from the fifth taken from the polytheists of Banu Dhuhl. So he took a part of them, for Banu Dhuhl embraced Islam.
13.2984 : He then asked AbuBakr for them later on, and brought to him the document of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). So AbuBakr wrote for him that he should be given one thousand two hundred sa's from the sadaqah of al-Yamamah; four thousand (sa's) of wheat, four thousand (sa's) of barley, and four thousand (sa's) of dates.
13.2984 : The text of the document written by the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) for Mujja'ah was as follows: "In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. This document is from Muhammad, the Prophet, to Mujja'ah ibn Mirarah of Banu Sulma. I have given him one hundred camels from the first fifth acquired from the polytheist of Banu Dhuhl as a compensation for his brother."
13.2993 : Narrated Yazid ibn Abdullah:
13.2993 : We were at Mirbad. A man with dishevelled hair and holding a piece of red skin in his hand came.
13.2993 : We said: You appear to be a bedouin.  He said: Yes.  We said: Give us this piece of skin in your hand. He then gave it to us and we read it. It contained the text: "From Muhammad, Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), to Banu Zuhayr ibn Uqaysh. If you bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah, offer prayer, pay zakat, pay the fifth from the booty, and the portion of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and his special portion (safi), you will be under by the protection of Allah and His Apostle."
13.2993 : We then asked: Who wrote this document for you?  He replied: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him).
13.2996 : Narrated Muhayyisah:
13.2996 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: If you gain a victory over the men of Jews, kill them. So Muhayyisah jumped over Shubaybah, a man of the Jewish merchants. He had close relations with them. He then killed him. At that time Huwayyisah (brother of Muhayyisah) had not embraced Islam. He was older than Muhayyisah. When he killed him, Huwayyisah beat him and said: O enemy of Allah, I swear by Allah, you have a good deal of fat in your belly from his property.
13.2998 : Narrated A man from the companions of the Prophet:
13.2998 : Abdur Rahman ibn Ka'b ibn Malik reported on the authority of a man from among the companions of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him): The infidels of the Quraysh wrote (a letter) to Ibn Ubayy and to those who worshipped idols from al-Aws and al-Khazraj, while the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was at that time at Medina before the battle of Badr.
13.2998 : (They wrote): You gave protection to our companion. We swear by Allah, you should fight him or expel him, or we shall come to you in full force, until we kill your fighters and appropriate your women.
13.2998 : When this (news) reached Abdullah ibn Ubayy and those who were worshippers of idols, with him they gathered together to fight the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him).
13.2998 : When this news reached the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), he visited them and said: The threat of the Quraysh to you has reached its end. They cannot contrive a plot against you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this from the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), they scattered. This reached the infidels of the Quraysh.
13.2998 : The infidels of the Quraysh again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter reached the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), they gathered Banu an-Nadir to violate the treaty.
13.2998 : They sent a message to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him): Come out to us with thirty men from your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator then narrated the whole story.
13.2998 : When the next day came, the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) went out in the morning with an army, and surrounded them.
13.2998 : He told them: I swear by Allah, you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with me. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore fought them the same day.
13.2998 : Next he attacked Banu Quraysh with an army in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to sign a treaty and they signed it.
13.2998 : He turned away from them and attacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until they agreed to expulsion. Banu an-Nadir were deported, and they took with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their property, the doors of their houses, and their wood. Palm-trees were exclusively reserved for the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). Allah bestowed them upon him and gave them him as a special portion.
13.2998 : He (Allah), the Exalted, said: What Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (and taken away) from them, for this ye made no expedition with either camel corps or cavalry." He said: "Without fighting." So the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) gave most of it to the emigrants and divided it among them; and he divided some of it between two men from the helpers, who were needy, and he did not divide it among any of the helpers except those two. The rest of it survived as the sadaqah of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) which is in the hands of the descendants of Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her).
13.3000 : Narrated Abdullah Ibn Umar:
13.3000 : The Prophet fought with the people of Khaybar, and captured their palm-trees and land, and forced them to remain confined to their fortresses. So they concluded a treaty of peace providing that gold, silver and weapons would go to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), and whatever they took away on their camels would belong to them, on condition that they would not hide and carry away anything. If they did (so), there would be no protection for them and no treaty (with Muslims).
13.3000 : They carried away a purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab who was killed before (the battle of) Khaybar. He took away the ornaments of Banu an-Nadir when they were expelled.
13.3000 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) asked Sa'yah: Where is the purse of Huyayy ibn Akhtab?
13.3000 : He replied: The contents of this purse were spent on battles and other expenses. (Later on) they found the purse. So he killed Ibn AbulHuqayq, captured their women and children, and intended to deport them.
13.3000 : They said: Muhammad, leave us to work on this land; we shall have half (of the produce) as you wish, and you will have half. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to make a contribution of eighty wasqs of dates and twenty wasqs of wheat to each of his wives.
13.3001 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Umar:
13.3001 : Umar said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had transaction with the Jews of Khaybar on condition that we should expel them when we wish. If anyone has property (with them), he should take it back, for I am going to expel the Jews. So he expelled them.
13.3006 : Narrated A Group of Companions of the Prophet:
13.3006 : Bashir ibn Yasar, the client of the Ansar, reported on the authority of a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him): When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) conquered Khaybar, he divided it into thirty-six lots, each lot comprising one hundred portions. One half of it was for the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and for the Muslims; and he separated the remaining half for the deputations which came to him, other matters and emergent needs of the people.
13.3008 : Narrated Bashir ibn Yasar:
13.3008 : When Allah bestowed Khaybar on the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) as fay' (spoils of war without fighting), he divided the whole into thirty six lots. He put aside a half, i.e. eighteen lots, for the Muslims. Each lot comprised one hundred shares, and the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) was with them. He received a share like the share of one of them.
13.3008 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) separated eighteen lots, that is, half, for his future needs and whatever befell the Muslims. These were al-Watih, al-Kutaybah, as-Salalim and their colleagues. When all this property came in the possession of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and of the Muslims, they did not have sufficient labourers to work on it. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) called Jews and employed them on contract.
13.3009 : Narrated Mujammi' ibn Jariyah al-Ansari,:
13.3009 : Khaybar was divided among the people of al-Hudaybiyyah. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) divided it into eighteen portions. The army contained one thousand and five hundred people. There were three hundred horsemen among them. He gave double share to the horsemen, and a single to the footmen.
13.3010 : Narrated Abdullah ibn AbuBakr:
13.3010 : Abdullah ibn AbuBakr and some children of Muhammad ibn Maslamah said: There remained some people of Khaybar and they confined themselves to the fortresses. They asked the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) to protect their lives and let them go. He did so. The people of Fadak heard this; they also adopted a similar way. (Fadak) was, therefore, exclusively reserved for the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), for it was not captured by the expedition of cavalry and camelry.
13.3013 : Narrated Ibn Shihab:
13.3013 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) took out his fifth from the booty of Khaybar, and divided the rest of it among those who attended the battle and among those who were away from it but attend the expedition of al-Hudaybiyyah.
13.3015 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
13.3015 : Al-Abbas ibn AbdulMuttalib brought AbuSufyan ibn Harb to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) in the year of the conquest (of Mecca). So he embraced Islam at Marr az-Zahran. Al-Abbas said to him: Apostle of Allah, AbuSufyan is a man who likes taking this pride, if you may do something for him.  He said: Yes, he who enters the house of AbuSufyan is safe, and he who closes his door is safe.
13.3016 : Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:
13.3016 : When the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) alighted at Marr az-Zahran, al-Abbas said: I thought, I swear by Allah, if the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) enters Mecca with the army by force before the Quraysh come to him and seek protection from him, it will be their total ruin. So I rode on the mule of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and thought, Perhaps I may find a man coming for his needs who will to the people of Mecca and inform them of the position of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), so that they may come to him and seek protection from him. While I was on my way, I heard AbuSufyan and Budayl ibn Warqa' speaking.
13.3016 : I said: O AbuHanzalah!  He recognized my voice and said: AbulFadl?  I replied: Yes.  He said: who is with you, may my parents be a sacrifice for you?  I said: Here are the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and his people (with him).
13.3016 : He asked: Which is the way out?  He said: He rode behind me, and his companion returned. When the morning came, I brought him to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) and he embraced Islam.
13.3016 : I said: Apostle of Allah, AbuSufyan is a man who likes this pride, do something for him.  He said: Yes, he who enters the house of AbuSufyan is safe; he who closes the door upon him is safe; and he who enters the mosque is safe. The people scattered to their houses and in the mosque.
13.3013 : Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:
13.3013 : Wahb said: I asked Jabir about the condition of Thaqif when they took the oath of allegiance. He said: They stipulated to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) that there would be no sadaqah (i.e. zakat) on them nor Jihad (striving in the way of Allah). He then heard the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) say: Later on they will give sadaqah (zakat) and will strive in the way of Allah when they embrace Islam.
13.3020 : Narrated Uthman ibn Abul'As:
13.3020 : When the deputation of Thaqif came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), he made them stay in the mosque, so that it might soften their hearts. They stipulated to him that they would not be called to participate in Jihad, to pay zakat and to offer prayer. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: You may have the concession that you will not be called to participate in jihad and pay zakat, but there is no good in a religion which has no bowing (i.e. prayer).
13.3021 : Narrated Amir ibn Shahr:
13.3021 : When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) appeared as a prophet, Hamdan said to me: Will you go to this man and negotiate for us (with him)? If you accept something, we shall accept it, and if you disapprove of something, we shall disapprove of it.
13.3021 : I said: Yes. So I proceeded until I came to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). I liked his motive and my people embraced Islam. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) wrote the document for Umayr Dhu Marran. He also sent Malik ibn Murarah ar-Rahawi to all the (people of) Yemen. So Akk Dhu Khaywan embraced Islam.
13.3021 : Akk was told: Go to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), and obtain his protection for your town and property. He therefore came (to him) and the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) wrote a document for him:
13.3021 : "In the name of Allah, Most Beneficent, Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Apostle of Allah, to Akk Dhu Khaywan. If he is true his land, property and slave, he has the security and the protection of Allah, and Muhammad, the Apostle of Allah. Written by Khalid ibn Sa'id ibn al-'As."

13.3049 : He said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and feed him.
13.3049 : A man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body of merchants.
13.3049 : When he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian.  I said: I am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said harsh words to me.  He asked me: Do you know how many days remain in the completion of this month?  I replied: The time is near.  He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) returned to his family. I sought permission from him and he gave me permission.
13.3049 : I said: Apostle of Allah, may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (peace_be_upon_him) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I intended to be on my way.
13.3049 : All of a sudden I saw a man running towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). So I went till I reached him. I found four mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought permission.
13.3049 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to me: Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling on the ground?
13.3049 : I replied: Yes.  He said: You may have these mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and pay off your debt. I did so.
13.3049 : He then mentioned the rest of the tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was sitting there. I greeted him.
13.3049 : He asked: What benefit did you have from your property?  I replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). Nothing remains now.
13.3049 : He asked: Did anything remain (from that property)?  I said: Yes.  He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some comfort from it. When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)?
13.3049 : I said: I still have it, no one came to me. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) passed the night in the mosque.
13.3049 : He then narrated the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)?
13.3049 : I replied: Allah has given you comfort from it, Apostle of Allah.  He said: Allah is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die while it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his wives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his place where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you asked me.

They said: AbuHamzah, (here is the bier of) an Ansari woman. They brought her near him and there was a green cupola-shaped structure over her bier. He stood opposite her hips and led the funeral prayer over her as he had led it over the man. He then sat down.
14.3188 : Al-Ala' ibn Ziyad asked: AbuHamzah, did the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say the funeral prayer over the dead as you have done, uttering four takbirs (Allah is Most Great) over her, and standing opposite the head of a man and the hips of a woman?
14.3188 : He replied: Yes.  He asked: AbuHamzah, did you fight with the Apostle of Allah?  He replied: Yes. I fought with him in the battle of Hunayn. The polytheists came out and invaded us so severely that we saw our horses behind our backs.

14.3188 : When he saw the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), he said: Apostle of Allah, I have repented to Allah. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) stopped (for a while) receiving his oath of allegiance, so that the other man might fulfil his vow. But the man began to wait for the order of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) for his murder. He was afraid of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) to kill him. When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) saw that he did not do anything, he received his oath of allegiance.  The man said: Apostle of Allah, what about my vow?  He said: I stopped (receiving his oath of allegiance) today so that you might fulfil your vow.  He said: Apostle of Allah, why did you not give any signal to me?  The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: It is not worthy of a Prophet to give a signal.
14.3188 : AbuGhalib said: I asked (the people) about Anas standing opposite the hips of a woman. They told me that this practice was due to the fact that (in the days of the Prophet) there were no cupola-shaped structures over the biers of women. So the imam used to stand opposite the hips of a woman to hide her from the people.

O Allah, to whomsoever of us Thou givest life grant him life as a believer, and whomsoever of us Thou takest in death take him in death as a follower of Islam.

30.1579.4230 : He replied: It will be flight and plunder. Then will come a test which is pleasant. Its murkiness is due to the fact that it is produced by a man from the people of my house, who will assert that he belongs to me, whereas he does not, for my friends are only the God-fearing. Then the people will unite under a man who will be like a hip-bone on a rib. Then there will be the little black trial which will leave none of this community without giving him a slap, and when people say that it is finished, it will be extended. During it a man will be a believer in the morning and an infidel in the evening, so that the people will be in two camps: the camp of faith which will contain no hypocrisy, and the camp of hypocrisy which will contain no faith. When that happens, expect the Antichrist (Dajjal) that day or the next.

30.1579.4232 : He replied: Yes.  I asked: Wherein does the protection from it lie?  He replied: In the sword.  I asked: Apostle of Allah, what will then happen?

30.1579.4234 : I asked: Apostle of Allah, will there be good after this evil? He replied: An illusory truce and a community with specks in its eye.  I asked: Apostle of Allah, what do you mean by an illusory community?
30.1579.4234 : He replied: The hearts of the people will not return to their former condition.  I asked: Apostle of Allah, will there be evil after this good?  He replied: There will be wrong belief which will blind and deafen men to the truth in which there will be summoners at the gates of Hell. If you, Hudhayfah, die adhering to a stump, it will be better for you than following any of them.

The Kingdom of my community will reach as far as the earth was folded for me. The two treasures, the red and the white, were bestowed on me. I prayed to my Lord that He may not destroy my community by a prevailing famine, and not give their control to an enemy who annihiliates them en masse except from among themselves. My Lord said to me: Muhammad, if I make a decision, it is not withdrawn; and I shall not destroy them by a prevailing famine, and I shall not give their control to an enemy, except from among themselves, who exterminates them en masse, even if they are stormed from all sides of the earth; only a section of them will destroy another section, and a section will captivate another section. I am afraid about my community of those leaders who will lead astray. When the sword is used among my people, it will not be withdrawn from them till the Day of Resurrection, and the Last Hour will not come before the tribes of my people attach themselves to the polytheists and tribes of my people worship idols. There will be among my people thirty great liars each of them assertinf that he is (Allah's) prophet, whereas I am the Seal of the Prophets after whom (me) there will be no prophet; and a section of my people will continue to hold to the truth - (according to Ibn 'Isa's version: (will continue to dominate) - the agreed version goes: "and will not be injured by those who oppose them, till Allah's command comes."

So Allah revealed the verse "unless he repents, beleives and works righteous deeds, for Allah will change the evil of such persons into good. (Qur'an xxv. 70)" This is meant for them. As regards the verse "If a man kills a beleiver intentionally, his recompense is Hell (Quran iv. 93)" he said: If a man knows the command of Islam and intentionally kills a beleiver, his repentance will not be accepted.

An expeditionary force will then be sent against him from Syria but will be swallowed up in the desert between Mecca and Medina. When the people see that, the eminent saints of Syria and the best people of Iraq will come to him and swear allegiance to him between the Corner and the Maqam.
31.1568.4273 : Then there will arise a man of Quraysh whose maternal uncles belong to Kalb and send against them an expeditionary force which will be overcome by them, and that is the expedition of Kalb.

33.4405 : He replied: With so and so.  He asked: Did you lie down with her?  He replied: Yes.  He asked: Had your skin been in contact with hers?  He replied. Yes.  He asked: Did you have intercourse with her?  He said: Yes. So he (the Prophet) gave orders that he should be stoned to death. He was then taken out to the Harrah, and while he was being stoned he felt the effect of the stones and could not bear it and fled. But Abdullah ibn Unays encountered him when those who had been stoning him could not catch up with him. He threw the bone of a camel's foreleg at him, which hit him and killed him. They then went to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and reported it to him.
33.4405 : He said: Why did you not leave him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been forgiven by Allah.
33.4406 : Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:
33.4406 : Muhammad ibn Ishaq said: I mentioned the story of Ma'iz ibn Malik to Asim ibn Umar ibn Qatadah.  He said to me: Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn AbuTalib said to me: Some men of the tribe of Aslam whom I do not blame and whom you like have transmitted to me the saying of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him): Why did you not leave him alone?
33.4406 : He said: But I did not understand this tradition. So I went to Jabir ibn Abdullah and said (to him): Some men of the tribe of Aslam narrate that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said when they mentioned to him the anxiety of Ma'iz when the stones hurt him: "Why did you not leave him alone?' But I do not know this tradition.
33.4406 : He said: My cousin, I know this tradition more than the people. I was one of those who had stoned the man.  When we came out with him, stoned him and he felt the effect of the stones, he cried: O people! return me to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). My people killed me and deceived me; they told me that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) would not kill me. We did not keep away from him till we killed him. When we returned to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) we informed him of it.
33.4406 : He said: Why did you not leave him alone and bring him to me? and he said this so that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) might ascertain it from him. But he did not say this to abandon the prescribed punishment. He said: I then understood the intent of the tradition.
33.4407 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
33.4407 : Ma'iz ibn Malik came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and said that he had committed fornication and he (the Prophet) turned away from him. He repeated it many times, but he (the Prophet) turned away from him. He asked his people: Is he mad? They replied: There is no defect in him. He asked: Have you done it with her? He replied: Yes. so he ordered that he should be stoned to death. He was taken out and stoned to death, and he (the Prophet) did not pray over him.
33.4412 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
33.4412 : Ma'iz ibn Malik came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and admitted fornication twice. But he drove him away. He then came and admitted fornication twice. But he drove him away. He then came and admitted fornication twice. He (the Prophet) said: You have testified to yourself four times. Take him away and stone him to death.
33.4413 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
33.4413 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said to Ma'iz ibn Malik: Perhaps you kissed, or squeezed, or looked. He said: No. He then said: Did you have intercourse with her? He said: Yes. On the (reply) he (the Prophet) gave order that he should be stoned to death.
33.4414 : Narrated AbuHurayrah:
33.4414 : A man of the tribe of Aslam came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and testified four times against himself that he had had illicit intercourse with a woman, while all the time the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) was turning away from him.
33.4414 : Then when he confessed a fifth time, he turned round and asked: Did you have intercourse with her? He replied: Yes.  He asked: Have you done it so that your sexual organ penetrated hers? He replied: Yes.  He asked: Have you done it like a collyrium stick when enclosed in its case and a rope in a well? He replied: Yes. He asked: Do you know what fornication is?  He replied: Yes. I have done with her unlawfully what a man may lawfully do with his wife.
33.4414 : He then asked: What do you want from what you have said?  He said: I want you to purify me. So he gave orders regarding him and he was stoned to death. Then the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) heard one of his companions saying to another: Look at this man whose fault was concealed by Allah but who would not leave the matter alone, so that he was stoned like a dog. He said nothing to them but walked on for a time till he came to the corpse of an ass with its legs in the air.
33.4414 : He asked: Where are so and so?  They said: Here we are, Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him)!  He said: Go down and eat some of this ass's corpse. They replied: Apostle of Allah! Who can eat any of this?  He said: The dishonour you have just shown to your brother is more serious than eating some of it. By Him in Whose hand my soul is, he is now among the rivers of Paradise and plunging into them.
33.4420 : Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib:
33.4420 : We, the Companions of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), used to talk mutually: Would that al-Ghamidiyyah and Ma'iz ibn Malik had withdrawn after their confession; or he said: Had they not withdrawn after their confession, he would not have pursued them (for punishment). He had them stoned after the fourth (confession).
33.4421 : Narrated Al-Lajlaj al-Amiri:

33.4421 : He then turned towards her and asked: Who is the father of this child with you?

33.4421 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said to him: Are you married?  He said: Yes. So he gave orders regarding him and he was stoned to death.
33.4421 : He (the narrator) said: We took him out, dug a pit for him and put him in it. We then threw stones at him until he died. A man then came asking about the man who was stoned.
33.4421 : We brought him to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and said: This man has come asking about the wicked man.
33.4421 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: He is more agreeable than the fragrance of musk in the eyes of Allah. The man was his father. We then helped him in washing, shrouding and burying him. (The narrator said:) I do not know whether he said or did not say "in praying over him." This is the tradition of Abdah, and it is more accurate.
33.4423 : Narrated Sahl ibn Sa'd:
33.4423 : A man came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and confessed before him that he had committed fornication with a woman whom he named. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) sent for the woman and asked her about it. But she denied that she had committed fornication. So he inflicted the prescribed punishment of flogging on him, and let her go.
33.4424 : Narrated Jabir ibn Abdullah:
33.4424 : A man committed fornication with a woman. So the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) ordered regarding him and the prescribed punishment of flogging was inflicted on him. He was then informed that he was married. So he commanded regarding him and he was stoned to death.

33.4426 : A woman belonging to the tribe of Juhaynah (according to the version of Aban) came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and said that she had committed fornication and that she was pregnant. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) called her guardian.
33.4426 : Then the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to him: Be good to her, and when she bears a child, bring her (to me). When she gave birth to the child, he brought her (to him). The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) gave orders regarding her, and her clothes were tied to her. He then commanded regarding her and she was stoned to death. He commanded the people (to pray) and they prayed over her.
33.4426 : Thereupon Umar said: Are you praying over her, Apostle of Allah, when she has committed fornication?
33.4426 : He said: By Him in Whose hand my soul is, she has repented to such an extent that if it were divided among the seventy people of Medina, it would have been enough for them all. And what do you find better than the fact that she gave her life.
33.4426 : Aban did not say in his version: Then her clothes were tied to her.

33.4433 : The people passed by the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) with a Jew who was blackened with charcoal and who was being flogged.
33.4433 : He called them and said: Is this the prescribed punishment for a fornicator?
33.4433 : They said: Yes.  He then called on a learned man among them and asked him: I adjure you by Allah Who revealed the Torah to Moses, do you find this prescribed punishment for a fornicator in your divine Book?
33.4433 : He said: By Allah, no. If you had not adjured me about this, I should not have informed you. We find stoning to be prescribed punishment for a fornicator in our Divine Book. But it (fornication) became frequent in our people of rank; so when we seized a person of rank, we left him alone, and when we seized a weak person, we inflicted the prescribed punishment on him. So we said: Come, let us agree on something which may be enforced equally on people of higher and lower rank. So we agreed to blacken the face of a criminal with charcoal, and flog him, and we abandoned stoning.
33.4433 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then said: O Allah, I am the first to give life to Thy command which they have killed. So he commanded regarding him (the Jew) and he was stoned to death.
33.4433 : Allah Most High then sent down: "O Apostle, let not those who race one another into unbelief, make thee grieve..." up to "They say: If you are given this, take it, but if not, beware!...." up to "And if any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) unbelievers," about Jews, up to "And if any do fail to judge by (the right of) what Allah hath revealed, they are no better than) wrong-doers" about Jews: and revealed the verses up to "And if any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel." About this he said: This whole verse was revealed about the infidels.
33.4434 : Narrated Abdullah Ibn Umar:
33.4434 : A group of Jews came and invited the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) to Quff. So he visited them in their school.
33.4434 : They said: AbulQasim, one of our men has committed fornication with a woman; so pronounce judgment upon them.  They placed a cushion for the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) who sat on it and said: Bring the Torah. It was then brought. He then withdrew the cushion from beneath him and placed the Torah on it saying: I believed in thee and in Him Who revealed thee.
33.4434 : He then said: Bring me one who is learned among you. Then a young man was brought. The transmitter then mentioned the rest of the tradition of stoning similar to the one transmitted by Malik from Nafi'(No. 4431).
33.4435 : Narrated AbuHurayrah:
33.4435 : (This is Ma'mar's version which is more accurate.) A man and a woman of the Jews committed fornication.
33.4435 : Some of them said to the others: Let us go to this Prophet, for he has been sent with an easy law. If he gives a judgment lighter than stoning, we shall accept it, and argue about it with Allah, saying: It is a judgment of one of your prophets. So they came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) who was sitting in the mosque among his companions.
33.4435 : They said: AbulQasim, what do you think about a man and a woman who committed fornication? He did not speak to them a word till he went to their school.
33.4435 : He stood at the gate and said: I adjure you by Allah Who revealed the Torah to Moses, what (punishment) do you find in the Torah for a person who commits fornication, if he is married?
33.4435 : They said: He shall be blackened with charcoal, taken round a donkey among the people, and flogged. A young man among them kept silent.
33.4435 : When the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) emphatically adjured him, he said: By Allah, since you have adjured us (we inform you that) we find stoning in the Torah (is the punishment for fornication).
33.4435 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: So when did you lessen the severity of Allah's command? He said:
33.4435 : A relative of one of our kings had committed fornication, but his stoning was suspended. Then a man of a family of common people committed fornication. He was to have been stoned, but his people intervened and said: Our man shall not be stoned until you bring your man and stone him. So they made a compromise on this punishment between them.
33.4435 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: So I decide in accordance with what the Torah says. He then commanded regarding them and they were stoned to death.
33.4435 : Az-Zuhri said: We have been informed that this verse was revealed about them: "It was We Who revealed the Law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the Prophet who bowed (as in Islam) to Allah's will.
33.4441 : Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:
33.4441 : while I was wandering in search of my camels which had strayed, a caravan or some horsemen carrying a standard came forward. The bedouin began to go round me for my position with the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). They came to a domed structure, took out a man from it, and struck his neck. I asked about him. They told me that he had married his father's wife.
33.4442 : Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib:
33.4442 : I met my uncle who was carrying a standard. I asked him: Where are you going? He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) has sent me to a man who has married his father's wife. He has ordered me to cut off his head and take his property.
33.4443 : Narrated An-Nu'man ibn Bashir:
33.4443 : Habib ibn Salim said: A man called AbdurRahman ibn Hunayn had intercourse with his wife's slave-girl. The matter was brought to an-Nu'man ibn Bashir who was the Governor of Kufah. He said: I shall decide between you in accordance with the decision of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him). If she made her lawful for you, I shall flog you one hundred lashes. If she did not make her lawful for you, I shall stone you to death. So they found that she had made her lawful for him. He, therefore, flogged him one hundred lashes.
33.4444 : Narrated An-Nu'man ibn Bashir:
33.4444 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: about a man who had (unlawful) intercourse with his wife's slave girl: If she made her lawful for him, he will be flogged one hundred lashes; if she did not make her lawful for him, I shall stone him.

33.4446 : Narrated Salamah ibn al-Muhabbaq:

33.4457 : AbuUmamah ibn Sahl ibn Hunayf said that some companions of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) told that one of their men suffered so much from some illness that he pined away until he was skin and bone (i.e. only a skeleton). A slave-girl of someone visited him, and he was cheered by her and had unlawful intercourse with her. When his people came to visit the patient, he told them about it.
33.4457 : He said: Ask the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) about the legal verdict for me, for I have had unlawful intercourse with a slave-girl who visited me.
33.4457 : So they mentioned it to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) saying: We have never seen anyone (so weak) from illness as he is. If we bring him to you, his bones will disintegrate. He is only skin and bone. So the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) commanded them to take one hundred twigs and strike him once.
33.4458 : Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:
33.4458 : A slave-girl belonging to the house of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) committed fornication. He (the Prophet) said: Rush up, Ali, and inflict the prescribed punishment on her.

And inflict the prescribed punishment on those whom your right hands possess (i.e. slaves).

33.4466 : Narrated Ali ibn AbuTalib:

He was again brought to him and he flogged him. The punishment of killing (for drinking) was  repealed, and a concession was allowed.
33.4472 : Narrated AbdurRahman ibn Azhar:
33.4472 : I can still picture myself looking at the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) who was among the camps of the Companions seeking the camp of Khalid ibn al-Walid, when a man who had drunk wine was brought before him. He asked the people: Beat him. Some struck him with sandals, some with sticks and some with fresh branches of the palm-tree (mitakhah). Ibn Wahb said: This (mitakhah) means green palm fronds.

Uthman (after him) inflicted both punishments, eighty and forty stripes, and finally Mu'awiyah established eighty stripes.
33.4474 : Narrated AbdurRahman ibn Azhar:
33.4474 : I saw the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) on the morning of the conquest of Mecca when I was a young boy. He was walking among the people, seeking the camp of Khalid ibn al-Walid. A man who had drunk wine was brought (before him) and he ordered them (to beat him). So they beat him with what they had in their hands. Some struck him with whips, some with sticks and some with sandals. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) threw some dust on his face.
33.4474 : When a man who had drunk wine was brought before AbuBakr, he asked them (i.e. the people) about the number of beatings which they gave him. They numbered it forty. So AbuBakr gave him forty lashes.
33.4474 : When Umar came to power, Khalid ibn al-Walid wrote to him: The people have become addicted to drinking wine and they look down upon the prescribed punishment and its penalty.
33.4474 : He said: They are with you, ask them. The immigrants who embraced Islam in the beginning were with him. He asked them and they agreed on the fact that (a drunkard) should be given eighty lashes.

34.1644.4479 : Qurayzah and Nadir (were two Jewish tribes). An-Nadir were nobler than Qurayzah. When a man of Qurayzah killed a man of an-Nadir, he would be killed. But if a man of an-Nadir killed a man of Qurayzah, a hundred wasq of dates would be paid as blood-money. When Prophethood was bestowed upon the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him), a man of an-Nadir killed a man of Qurayzah.
34.1644.4479 : They said: Give him to us, we shall kill him. They replied: We have the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) between you and us. So they came to him.
34.1644.4479 : Thereupon the following verse was revealed: "If thou judge, judge in equity between them." "In equity" means life for a life.

34.1645.4480 : Narrated Abu Rimthah:
34.1645.4480 : I went to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) with my father. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then asked my father: Is this your son? He replied: Yes, by the Lord of the Ka'bah. He again said: Is it true? He said: I bear witness to it. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then smiled for my resemblance with my father, and for the fact that my father took an oath upon me. He then said: He will not bring evil on you, nor will you bring evil on him. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) recited the verse: "No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another."
34.1646.4481 : Narrated Abu Shurayh al-Khuza'i:
34.1646.4481 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: If a relative of anyone is killed, or if he suffers khabl, which means a wound, he may choose one of the three things: he may retaliate, or forgive, or receive compensation. But if he wishes a fourth (i.e. something more), hold his hands. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty.
34.1646.4482 : Narrated Anas ibn Malik:
34.1646.4482 : I never saw the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) that some dispute which involved retaliation was brought to him but he commanded regarding it for remission.
34.1646.4483 : Narrated Abu Hurayrah:
34.1646.4483 : A man was killed in the lifetime of the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). The matter was brought to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him). He entrusted him to the legal guardian of the slain. The slayer said: Apostle of Allah, I swear by Allah, I did not intend to kill him. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to the legal guardian: Now if he is true and you kill him, you will enter Hell-fire. So he let him go. His hands were tied with a strap. He came out pulling his strap. Hence he was called Dhu an-Nis'ah (possessor of strap).
34.1646.4484 : Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:
34.1646.4484 : I was with the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) when a man who was a murderer and had a strap round his neck was brought to him.
34.1646.4484 : He then called the legal guardian of the victim and asked him: Do you forgive him?
34.1646.4484 : He said: No. He asked: Will you accept the blood-money? He said: No. He asked: Will you kill him? He said: Yes. He said: Take him. When he turned his back, he said: Do you forgive him? He said: No. He said: Will you accept the blood-money? He said: No. He said: Will you kill him? He said: Yes. He said: Take him. After repeating all this a fourth time, he said: If you forgive him, he will bear the burden of his own sin and the sin of the victim. He then forgave him. He (the narrator) said: I saw him pulling the strap.
34.1646.4485 : The tradition mentioned above has also been mentioned by 'Alqamah b. Wa'il through a different chain of narrators and to the same effect.
34.1646.4486 : Narrated Wa'il ibn Hujr:
34.1646.4486 : A man brought an Abyssinian to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and said: This man has killed my nephew. He asked: How did you kill him? He replied: I struck his head with an axe but I did not intend to kill him. He asked: Have you some money so that you pay his blood-wit? He said: No. He said: What is your opinion if I send you so that you ask the people (for money) and thus collect your blood-wit? He said: No. He said: Will your masters give you his blood-wit (to pay his relatives)? He said: No. He said to the man. Take him. So he brought him out to kill him. The Apostle od Allah (peace be upon him) said: If he kills him, he will be like him. This (statement) reached the man where he was listening t the statement. He said: He is here; order regarding him as you like. The Apostle of Allah (peace ber upon him) said: Leave him alone. And he once said: He will bear the burden of the sin of the slain and his own and thus he will become one of the companions of Hell. So let him go.
34.1646.4487 : Narrated Uthman ibn Affan:
34.1646.4487 : Abu Umamah ibn Sahl said: We were with Uthman when he was besieged in the house. There was an entrance to the house. He who entered it heard the speech of those who were in the Bilat. Uthman then entered it. He came out to us, looking pale.
34.1646.4487 : He said: They are threatening to kill me now. We said: Allah will be sufficient for you against them, Commander of the Faithful! He asked: Why kill me? I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: It is not lawful to kill a man who is a Muslim except for one of the three reasons: Kufr (disbelief) after accepting Islam, fornication after marriage, or wrongfully killing someone, for which he may be killed.
34.1646.4487 : I swear by Allah, I have not committed fornication before or after the coming of Islam, nor did I ever want another religion for me instead of my religion since Allah gave guidance to me, nor have I killed anyone. So for what reason do you want to kill me?
34.1646.4487 : Abu Dawud said: 'Uthman and 'Abu bakr (Allah be pleased with them) abandoned drinking wine in pre-Islamic times.
34.1646.4488 : Narrated Sa'd ibn Dumayrah al-Aslami ; Dumayrah al-Aslami:
34.1646.4488 : Ziyad ibn Sa'd ibn Dumayrah as-Sulami said on the authority of his father (Sa'd) and his grandfather (Dumayrah) (according to Musa's version) who were present in the battle of Hunayn with the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him): After the advent of Islam, Muhallam ibn Jaththamah al-Laythi killed a man of Ashja'.
34.1646.4488 : That was the first blood-money decided by the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) (for payment). Uyaynah spoke about the killing of al-Ashja'i, for he belonged to Ghatafan, and al-Aqra' ibn Habis spoke on behalf of Muhallam, for he belonged to Khunduf. The voices rose high, and the dispute and noise grew.
34.1646.4488 : So the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do you not accept blood-money, Uyaynah?
34.1646.4488 : Uyaynah then said: No, I swear by Allah, until I cause his women to suffer the same fighting and grief as he caused my women to suffer. Again the voices rose high, and the dispute and noise grew.
34.1646.4488 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do you not accept the blood-money Uyaynah? Uyaynah gave the same reply as before, and a man of Banu Layth called Mukaytil stood up. He had a weapon and a skin shield in his hand.
34.1646.4488 : He said: I do not find in the beginning of Islam any illustration for what he has done except the one that "some sheep came on, and those in the front were shot; hence those in the rear ran away". (The other example is that) "make a law today and change it."
34.1646.4488 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Fifty (camels) here immediately and fifty when we return to Medina. This happened during some of his journeys. Muhallam was a tall man of dark complexion. He was with the people. They continued (to make effort for him) until he was released. He sat before the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him), with his eyes flowing.
34.1646.4488 : He said: Apostle of Allah! I have done (the act) of which you have been informed. I repent to Allah, the Exalted, so ask Allah's forgiveness for me. Apostle of Allah!
34.1646.4488 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then said: Did you kill him with your weapon at the beginning of Islam. O Allah! do not forgive Muhallam. He said these words loudly.
34.1646.4488 : AbuSalamah added: He (Muhallam) then got up while he was wiping his tears with the end of his garment.
34.1646.4488 : Ibn Ishaq said: His people alleged that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) asked forgiveness for him after that.

34.1647.4489 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Then you, Khuza'ah, have killed this man of Hudhayl, but I will pay his blood-wit. After these words of mine if a man of anyone is killed, his people will have a choice to accept blood-wit or to kill him.
34.1647.4490 : Narrated Abu Hurairah :
34.1647.4490 : When Mecca was conquered, the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) got up and said: If a relative of anyone is killed, he will have the choice between the two: he (the slayer) will either pay the blood-wit or he will be killed. A man of the Yemen called Abu Shah stood up and said: Write for me, Apostle of Allah. The narrator al-'Abbas (b. al-Walid) said: Write for me, (you people). The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Write (you people) for Abu Shah These are the wordings of the tradition of Ahmad.
34.1647.4490 : Abu Dawud said: Write (you people), (or me, that is, the address of the Prophet (may peace be upon him).
34.1647.4491 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:
34.1647.4491 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: A believer will not be killed for an infidel. If anyone kills a man deliberately, he is to be handed over to the relatives of the one who has been killed. If they wish, they may kill, but if they wish, they may accept blood-wit.

She was then brought to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) who asked her about it. She said: I intended to kill you. He said: Allah will not give you control over it; or he said: over me. They (the Companions) said: Should we not kill her? He said: No. He (Anas) said: I always found it in the uvula of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him).
34.1649.4494 : Narrated Abu Hurairah :
34.1649.4494 : A Jewess presented a poisoned sheep to the Prophet (may peace be upon him), but the Prophet (may peace be upon him) did not interfere with her.

34.1649.4495 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then said: Take your hands away (from the food). The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then sent someone to the Jewess and he called her.
34.1649.4495 : He said to her: Have you poisoned this sheep? The Jewess replied: Who has informed you? He said: This foreleg which I have in my hand has informed me. She said: Yes. He said: What did you intend by it? She said: I thought if you were a prophet, it would not harm you; if you were not a prophet, we should rid ourselves of him (i.e. the Prophet). The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then forgave her, and did not punish her. But some of his companions who ate it, died. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had himself cupped on his shoulder on account of that which he had eaten from the sheep. AbuHind cupped him with the horn and knife. He was a client of Banu Bayadah from the Ansar.
34.1649.4496 : Narrated Abu Salamah:
34.1649.4496 : A Jewess presented a roasted sheep to the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) at Khaybar.
34.1649.4496 : He then mentioned the rest of the tradition like that of Jabir (No. 4495). He said: Then Bashir ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died. He sent someone to call on the Jewess, and said to her (when she came): What motivated you to do the work you have done? He then mentioned the rest of the tradition similar to the one mentioned by Jabir (No. 4495).
34.1649.4496 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then ordered regarding her and she was killed. But he (Abu Salamah) did not mention the matter of cupping.
34.1649.4497 : Narrated Abu Hurairah :
34.1649.4497 : The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) would accept a present, but would not accept alms (sadaqah).
34.1649.4498 : Narrated Abu Salamah:
34.1649.4498 : Muhammad ibn Amr said on the authority of Abu Salamah, and he did not mention the name of AbuHurayrah: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) used to accept presents but not alms (sadaqah).
34.1649.4498 : This version adds: So a Jewess presented him at Khaybar with a roasted sheep which she had poisoned. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) ate of it and the people also ate.
34.1649.4498 : He then said: Take away your hands (from the food), for it has informed me that it is poisoned. Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur al-Ansari died.
34.1649.4498 : So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess (and said to her): What motivated you to do the work you have done?
34.1649.4498 : She said: If you were a prophet, it would not harm you; but if you were a king, I should rid the people of you. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then ordered regarding her and she was killed.

I do not think about the illness of my son except the poisoned sheep of which he had eaten with you at Khaybar. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: And I do not think about my illness except that. This is the time when it cut off my aorta.
34.1649.4499 : Abu Dawud said: Sometimes 'Abd al-Razzaq transmitted this tradition, omitting the link of the Companion, from Ma'rnar, from al-Zuhri, from the Prophet (may peace be upon him), and sometimes he transmitted it from al-Zuhri from 'Abd al -Rahman b. Ka'b b. Malik. 'Abd al-Rahman mentioned that Ma'mar sometimes trans-mitted the tradition in a mursal form (omitting the link of the Companion), and they recorded it, and sometimes he transmitted it in a mursal form (with a perfect chain) and they recorded it. And all this is correct with us. 'Abd al-Razzaq said: When Ibn al-Mubarak came to Ma'mar, he transmitted the traditions in a musnad form (with a perfect chain) which he transmitted as mauquf traditions (statements of the Companions and not of the Prophet).
34.1649.4500 : 'Abd aa-Rahman b. 'Abd Allah b. Ka'b b. Malik said on the authority of his mother that Umm Mubashshir said (Abu Sa'id b: al-A'rabi said: So he said it on the authority of his mother; what is correct is: on the authority of his father, instead of his mother): I entered upon the Prophet (may peace be upon him). He then men-tioned the tradition of Makhlad b. Khalid in a way similar to the tradition of Jabir. The narrator said: Then Bishr b. al-Bara' b. Ma'rur died. So he (the Prophet) sent for the Jewess and said: What did motivate you for the work you have done? He (the narrator) then mentioned the rest of the tradition like the tradition of Jabir. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) ordered regarding her and she was killed. He (the narrator in this version) did not mention cupping.
34.1650.4501 : Narrated Samurah:
34.1650.4501 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) Said: If anyone kills his slave, we shall kill him, and if anyone cuts off the nose of his slave, we shall cut off his nose.
34.1650.4502 : Qatadah said through the same chain of narrators as mentioned before, i.e. Samurah reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying.: If one castrates his slave, we shall castrate him. He then mentioned the rest of the addition like that of Shu'bah and Hammad.
34.1650.4502 : Abu Dawud said: Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi transmited it from Hisham like the condition of Mu'adh.
34.1650.4503 : Qatadah transmitted the tradition mentioned above through a chain of narrators like that of Shu'bah. This version adds: Then al-Hasan forgot this tradition, and he used to say: A free man is not to be killed for a slave.
34.1650.4504 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:
34.1650.4504 : A man came to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) crying for help. He said: His slave-girl, Apostle of Allah! He said: Woe to you, what happened with you ? He said that it was an evil one. He saw the slave-girl of his master; he became jealous of him, and cut off his penis. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: Bring the man to me. The man was called, but people could not get control over him. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then said: Go away, you are free. He asked: Apostle of Allah! upon whom does my help lie? He replied: On every believer, or he said: On every Muslim.
34.1650.4504 : Abu Dawud said: The name of the man who was emancipated was Rawh b. Dinar.
34.1650.4504 : Abu Dawud said: The man who cut off the penis was Zinba'.
34.1650.4504 : Abu Dawud said: This Zinba' Abu Rawh was master of the slave.
34.1651.4505 : Sahl b. Abi Hathmah and Rafi' b. Khadij said :
34.1651.4505 : Muhayyasah b. Mas'ud and 'Abd Allah b. Sahl came to Khaibar and parted (from each other) among palm trees. 'Abd Allah b. Sahl was killed. The Jews were blamed (for the murder). 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl and Huwayyasah and Mubayyasah, the sons of his uncle (Mas'ud) came to the Prophet (may peace be upon him). 'Abd al-Rahman, who was the youngest, spoke about his brother, but the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to him: (Respect) the elder, (respect) the elder, or be said: Let the eldest begin. They then spoke about their friend and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Fifty of you should take oaths regarding a man from them (the Jews) and he should be entrusted (to him) with his rope (in his neck). They said: It is a matter which we did not see. How can we take oaths? He said: The Jews exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them. They said : Apostle of Allah! They are a people who are infidels. So the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) paid them the bloodwit himself. Sahl said: Once I entered the resting place of their camels, and a she-camel struck me with her leg. Hammad said this or (something) similar to it.
34.1651.4505 : Abu Dawud said: Another version transmitted by Yahya b. Sa'id has: Would you swear fifty oaths and make your claim regarding your friend or your slain man? Bishr, the transmitter, did mention blood. 'Abdah transmitted it from Yahya -as transmitted by Hammad. Ibn 'Uyainah has also transmitted it from Yahya, and began with his words: The Jews will exonerate themselves by fifty oaths which they will swear He did not mention the claim.
34.1651.4505 : Abu Dawud said: This is a misunderstanding on the part of Ibn 'Uyainah.
34.1651.4506 : Sahl b. Abi Hathmah and some senior men of the tribe told that 'Abd Allah b. Abi Sahl and Muhayyasah came to Khaibar on account of the calamity (i.e. famine) that befell them. Muhayyasah came and told that 'Abd Allah b. Sahl had been killed and thrown in a well or a stream. He then came to the Jews and said: I swear by Allah, you have killed him. They said: We swear by Allah, we have not kill-ed him. He then proceeded and came to his tribe and mentioned this to them. Then he, his brother Huwayyasah, who was older than him, and 'Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl came forward (to the Prophet). Muhayyasah began to speak. It was he who was at Khaibar. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) then said to him: Let the eldest (speak), let the eldest (speak), meaning age. So Huwayyasah spoke, and after him Mubayyasah spoke. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) then said: They should either pay the bloodwit for your friend or they should be prepared for war. So the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) wrote to them about it. They wrote (in reply): We swear by Allah, we have not killed him. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be Upon him) then said to Huwayyasah, Muhayyasah and 'Abd al -Rahman: Will you take an oath and thus have the claim to the blood of your friend? They said: No. He (the Prophet) said: The Jews will then take an oath. They said: They are not Muslims. Then the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) himself paid the bloodwit. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) then sent on one hundred she-camels and they were entered in their house. Sahl said: A red she-camel of them gave me a kick.
34.1651.4507 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:
34.1651.4507 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) killed a man of Banu Nadr ibn Malik at Harrah ar-Righa' at the bank of Layyat al-Bahrah. The transmitter Mahmud (ibn Khalid) also mentioned the words along with the words "at Bahrah" "the slayer and the slain were from among them". Mahmud alone transmitted in this tradition the words "at the bank of Layyah".
34.1652.4508 : Bashir b. Yasir told that a man of the Ansar called Sahl b. Abu Hathmah told him that some people of his tribe went to Khaibar and separated there. They found one of them slain. They said to those with whom they had found him: You have killed our friend. They replied: We did not kill him, nor do we know the slayer. We (the people of the slain) then went to the Prophet of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said to them: Bring a proof against the one who has slain him. They replied: We have no proof. He said: Then they will take an oath for you. They said: We do not accept the oaths of the Jewr. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be' upon him) did not like that no responsibility should be fixed for his blood. So he himself paid his bloodwit consisting of one hundred camels of sadaqah (i.e. camels sent to the Pro-phet as zakat).
34.1652.4509 : Narrated Rafi' ibn Khadij:
34.1652.4509 : A man of the Ansar was killed at Khaybar and his relatives went to the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and mentioned that to him. He asked: Have you two witnesses who can testify to the murderer of your friend? They replied: Apostle of Allah! there was not a single Muslim present, but only Jews who sometimes have the audacity to do even greater crimes than this. He said: Then choose fifty of them and demand that they take an oath; but they refused and the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) paid the blood-wit himself.
34.1652.4510 : 'Abd al-Rahman b. Bujaid said I swear by Allah, Sahl had a misunder-standing Abuut this tradition. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) wrote to the Jews: A slain man has been found amongst you, so pay his bloodwit. They wrote (to him): Swearing by Allah fifty oaths, we neither killed him nor do we know his slayer. He said: Then the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) himself paid his bloodwit which consisted of one hundred she-camels.
34.1652.4511 : Narrated Some men:
34.1652.4511 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said to the Jews and started with them: Fifty of you should take the oaths. But they refused (to take the oaths). He then said to the Ansar: Prove your claim. They said: Do we take the oaths without seeing, Apostle of Allah? The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) then imposed the blood-wit on the Jews because he (the slain) was found among them.
34.1653.4512 : Narrated Anas :
34.1653.4512 : A girl was found with her head crushed between two stones. She was asked: Who has done this to you? Is it so and so? Is it so and so, until a Jew was named, and she gave a sigh with her head. The Jew was caught and he admitted. So the Prophet (may peace be upon him) gave command that his head should be crushed with stones.
34.1653.4513 : Narrated Anas:
34.1653.4513 : A Jew killed a girl of the Ansar for her ornaments. He then threw her in a well, and crushed her head with stones. He was then arrested and brought to the Prophet (may peace be upon him). He ordered regarding him that he should be stoned to death. He was then stoned till he died.
34.1653.4513 : Abu Dawud said.: It has been transmitted by Ibn Juraij from Ayyub in a similar way.
34.1653.4514 : Narrated Anas:
34.1653.4514 : A girl was wearing silver ornaments. A Jew crushed her head with a stone. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) entered upon her when she had some breath. He said to her: Who has killed you? Has so and so killed you? She replied: No, making a sign with her head. He again asked: Who has killed you? Has so and so killed you? She replied: No, making a sign with her head. He again asked: Has so and so killed you? She said: Yes, making a sign with her head. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) commanded regarding him, and he was killed between two stones.
34.1654.4515 : Narrated Ali ibn Abu Talib:
34.1654.4515 : Qays ibn Abbad and Ashtar went to Ali and said to him: Did the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) give you any instruction about anything for which he did not give any instruction to the people in general?
34.1654.4515 : He said: No, except what is contained in this document of mine. Musaddad said: He then took out a document. Ahmad said: A document from the sheath of his sword.
34.1654.4515 : It contained: The lives of all Muslims are equal; they are one hand against others; the lowliest of them can guarantee their protection. Beware, a Muslim must not be killed for an infidel, nor must one who has been given a covenant be killed while his covenant holds. If anyone introduces an innovation, he will be responsible for it. If anyone introduces an innovation or gives shelter to a man who introduces an innovation (in religion), he is cursed by Allah, by His angels, and by all the people.
34.1654.4515 : Musaddad said: Ibn AbuUrubah's version has: He took out a document.
34.1654.4516 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:
34.1654.4516 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said, mentioning the tradition similar to the one transmitted by Ali. This version adds: The most distant of them gives protection as from all, those who are strong among them send back (spoil) to those who are weak among them, and their expeditions sending it back to those who are at home.

The narrator 'Abd al-Wabhab said: (Listen) to what Sa'd is saying.
34.1655.4518 : Abu Hurairah told that Sa'd b. 'Ubadah said to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him): "What do you think if I find with my wife a man; should I give him some time until I bring four witnesses?" He said: Yes.

34.1656.4519 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: You may have so much and so much. But they did not agree. He again said: You may have so much and so much. But they did not agree. He again said: You may have so much and so much. So they agreed.
34.1656.4519 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: I am going to address the people in the afternoon and tell them about your consent.
34.1656.4519 : They said: Yes. Addressing (the people), the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: These people of faith came to me asking for revenge. I presented them with so much and so much and they agreed. Do you agree?
34.1656.4519 : They said: No. The immigrants (muhajirun) intended (to take revenge) on them. But the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) commanded them to refrain and they refrained.
34.1656.4519 : He then called them and increased (the amount), and asked: Do you agree? They replied: Yes. He said: I am going to address the people and tell them about your consent. They said: Yes. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) addressed and said: Do you agree? They said: Yes.
34.1657.4520 : Narrated Anas:
34.1657.4520 : A girl was found with her head crushed between two stones. She was asked: Who did it with you? Was it so and so? Was it so and so? Until the Jew was named.

34.1658.4521 : Narrated AbuSa'id al-Khudri:
34.1658.4521 : When the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was distributing something, a man came towards him and bent down on him. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) struck him with a bough and his face was wounded. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said to him: Come and take retaliation. He said: no, I have forgiven, Apostle of Allah!
34.1658.4522 : Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab:
34.1658.4522 : I did not send my collectors (of zakat) so that they strike your bodies and that they take your property. If that is done with someone and he appeals to me, I shall take retaliation on him. Amr ibn al-'As said: If any man (i.e. governor) inflicts disciplinary punishment on his subjects, would you take retaliation on him too? He said: Yes, by Him in Whose hand my soul is, I shall take retaliation on him. I saw that the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) has given retaliation on himself.
34.1659.4523 : Narrated 'A'isha, Ummul Mu'minin:
34.1659.4523 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) Said: The disputants should refrain from taking retaliation. The one who is nearer should forgive first and then the one who is next to him, even if (the one who forgives) were a woman.
34.1659.4523 : Abu Dawud said: I have been informed that forgiving by women in the case of murder is permissible if a woman were one of the heirs (of the slain). I have been told on the authority of Abu 'Ubaid about the meaning of the word yanhajizu, that is, they should refrain from retaliation.
34.1660.4524 : Tawus in his version said: If anyone is killed. Ibn 'Ubaid in his version said: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: If anyone is killed in error (blind-ly) when people are throwing stones, or by beating with whips, or striking with a stick, it is accidental and the compensation for accidental death is due. But if anyone is killed deliberately, retaliation is due. Ibn 'Ubaid said in his version: Retaliation of the man is due. The agreed version then goes: If anyone comes in (between the two parties) to prevent it, Allah's curse and anger will rest on him, and neither supereroga-tory nor obligatory acts will be accepted from him. The version of the tradition of Sufyan is more perfect.
34.1660.4525 : Ibn 'Abbas reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as say-ing. He then mentioned the rest of the tradition to the same effect as mentioned by Sufyan.

34.1661.4527 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As:
34.1661.4527 : The value of the blood-money at the time of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was eight hundred dinars or eight thousand dirhams, and the blood-money for the people of the Book was half of that for Muslims.
34.1661.4527 : He said: This applied till Umar (Allah be pleased with him) became caliph and he made a speech in which he said: Take note! Camels have become dear. So Umar fixed the value for those who possessed gold at one thousand dinars, for those who possessed silver at twelve thousand (dirhams), for those who possessed cattle at two hundred cows, for those who possessed sheep at two thousand sheep, and for those who possessed suits of clothing at two hundred suits. He left the blood-money for dhimmis (protected people) as it was, not raising it in proportion to the increase he made in the blood-wit.
34.1661.4528 : Narrated Ata' ibn Abu Rabah:
34.1661.4528 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) gave judgment that blood-wit for those who possessed camels should be one hundred camels, and for those who possessed cattle two hundred cows, and for those who possessed sheep one thousand sheep, and for those who possessed suits of clothing two hundred suits, and for those who possessed wheat something which the narrator Muhammad (ibn Ishaq) did not remember.
34.1661.4528 : Abu Dawud said: I read out to Sa'id b. Yaqub al-Taliqani who said: Abu Tumailah transmitted to us, saying: Muhammad b. Ishaq transmitted to us, saying: 'Ata reported Jabir b. Abd Allah as saying: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) fixed; and he mentioned the tradition like that of Musa; he said: And those who possess corn food should pay something which I do not remember.
34.1661.4529 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud:
34.1661.4529 : The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The blood-wit for accidental killing should be twenty she-camels which had entered their fourth year, twenty she-camels which had entered their fifth year, twenty she-camels which had entered their second year, twenty she-camels which had entered their third year, and twenty male camels which had entered their second year. It does not beyond Ibn Mas'ud.
34.1661.4530 : Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
34.1661.4530 : A man of Banu Adi was killed. The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) fixed his blood-wit at the rate of twelve thousand (dirhams).

34.1662.4531 : (Musaddad's version has): The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) made a speech on the day of the conquest of Mecca, and said: Allah is Most Great, three times. He then said: There is no god but Allah alone: He fulfilled His promise, helped His servant, and alone defeated the companies.
34.1662.4531 : (The narrator said:) I have remembered from Musaddad up to this.
34.1662.4531 : Then the agreed version has: Take note! All the merits mentioned in pre-Islamic times, and the claim made for blood or property are under my feet, except the supply of water to the pilgrims and the custody of the Ka'bah. He then said: The blood-money for unintentional murder which appears intentional, such as is done with a whip and a stick, is one hundred camels, forty of which are pregnant. Musaddad's version is more accurate.
34.1662.4532 : The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Khalid through the same chain of narrators to the same effect.
34.1662.4533 : The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Ibn 'Umar from the Prophet (may peace be upon him) to the same effect. This version has: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) addressed on the day of Conquest, or he said: On the conquest of Mecca on the ladder of the House or of the Ka'bah.
34.1662.4533 : Abu Dawud said: In a similar way Ibn 'Uyainah also transmitted it from 'Ali b. Zaid, from al-Qasim b. Rabi'ah, from Ibn 'Umar, from the Prophet (may peace be upon him); and Ayyub al-Sukhtiyani transmitted it from al-Qasim b. Rabi'ah from 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr like the tradition of Khalid. Hammad b. Salamah also transmit-ted it from 'Ali b. Zaid, from Ya'qub al-Sadusi, on the authority of 'Abd Allah b. 'Amr from the Prophet (may peace be upon him). The statements of Zaid and of Abu Musa are similar to the tradition of the Prophet (may peace be upon him) and to the tradition of 'Umar (Allah be pleased with him).
34.1662.4534 : Narrated Mujahid:
34.1662.4534 : 'Umar gave judgment that bloodwit for quasi-intentional murder should be thirty she-camels in their fourth year, thirty she-camels in their fifth year, and forty pregnant she-camels in their sixth year up to the ninth.

34.1662.4536 : The bloodwit for unintentional murder is in four parts: twenty-five she-camels in their fourth year, twenty-five she-camels in their fifth year, twenty-five she-camels in their third year, and twenty-five she-camels in their second year.
34.1662.4537 : Narrated 'Uthman b. 'Affan and Zaid b. Thabit :
34.1662.4537 : The bloodwit for what resembled intentional murder should be forty pregnant she-camels in their fifth year, thirty she-camels in their fourth year, and thirty she-camels in their third year. The bloodwit for unintentional murder is thirty she-camels in their fourth year, thirty she-camels in their third year, and twenty she-camels in their second year.
34.1662.4538 : Zaid b. Thabit said about the bloodwit for quasi-intentional murder.... He then mentioned a similar tradition as mentioned above.
34.1663.4539 : Abu Dawud said: Abu Dawud and others have said : When a she-camel enters her fourth year, the female is called hiqqah, and the male is called hiqq, for it deserves that it should be loaded and ridden. When a camel enters its fifth year, the male is called jadha' and the female is called jadha'ah. When it enters its sixth year, and sheds its front teeth, it is called thani (male) and thaniyyah (female). When it enters its seventh year, it is called raba' and raba'iyyah. When it enters its eighth year and sheds its teeth, it is known as sadis and sadis. When it enters its ninth year and cuts its canine teeth, it is called bazil. When it enters its tenth year, it is called mukh-lif. Then there is no name for it, but it is called balzilam and b�zil '�main, and mukhlif and mukhlif'amain, up to any year it increases. Nad b. Shumail said: Bint makhad is a she-camel of one year, and bint labun is a she-camel of two years, hiqqah is a she-camel of three years, jadha'ah is a she-camel of four years, thani is a camel of five years, raba' is a camel of six years, sadis is a camel of seven years, and bazil is a camel of eight years.
34.1663.4539 : Abu Dawud said: Abu Hatim and al-Asma'i said: A1-Jadhu'ah is a time when no tooth is growing? Abu Hatim said: Some of them said: When it sheds its teeth between front and canine teeth, it is called rAbu' and when it sheds its front teeth, it is called thani. Abu Ubaid said: When it becomes pregnant, it is called khaliifah, and it remains khahifah for ten months; when it reaches ten months, it is called 'uchara. Abu Hatim said: When it shed its front teeth, it is called thani and when it sheds its teeth between front and canine teeth it is called raba'.

Shu'aib said that his grandfather, Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) would fix the blood-money for accidental killing at the rate of four hundred dinars or their equivalent in silver for townsmen, and he would fix it according to the price of camels. So when they were dear, he increased the amount to be paid, and when cheap prices prevailed he reduced the amount to be paid. In the time of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) they reached between four hundred and eight hundred dinars, their equivalent in silver being eight thousand dirhams.
34.1664.4547 : He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) gave judgment that those who possessed cattle should pay two hundred cows, and those who possessed sheep two thousand sheep.
34.1664.4547 : He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: The blood-money is to be treated as something to be inherited by the heirs of the one who has been killed, and the remainder should be divided among the agnates.

For the hand, when it was cut of,f half of the blood-money was to be paid; for one foot of half, the blood-money was to be paid. For a wound in the head, a third of the blood-money was due, i.e. thirty-three camels and a third of the blood-money, or their equivalent in gold, silver, cows or sheep.

34.1664.4547 : The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) said: There is nothing for the murderer; and if he (the victim) has no heir, his heir will be the one who is nearest to him among the people, but the murderer should not inherit anything.

They brought the dispute to the Prophet (may peace be upon him). One of the two men said: How can we pay bloodwit for the one who did not make a noise, nor ate, nor drank, nor raised his voice? He (the Prophet) asked: Is it a rhymed prose like that of a bedouin? He gave judgment that a male or female slave of the best quality should be paid in compensation, and he fixed it to be paid by the woman's relatives on her father's side.
34.1665.4552 : The tradition mentioned above has also been transmitted by Mansur through a different chain of narrators and to the same effect.

The father of the woman who had slain said: He is a liar: I swear by Allah, he did not raise his voice, or drink or eat. No compensation is to be paid for an offence like this.

He made her Sons and those who were with them her heirs. Hamal b. Malik b. al-Nabighah al-Hudhali said: Apostle of Allah! how should I be fined for one who has not drunk, or eaten, or spoken, or raised his voice ?-adding that compensation is not to be paid for such (an offence). The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: This man simply belongs to the soothsayers on account of his rhymed prose which he his used.
